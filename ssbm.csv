"OK so I see this question a lot, but I have found myself asking it. 

How do I deal with falcos lasers?
 
Pretty much on any map, I play Fox and whenever I'm on the ground from any distance (besides up close) I get caught in lasers I don't know how to effectively get around it. What I find myself doing is jumping over them which gives up my stage control and puts me in a bad situation to get hit. I've seen in the past that I should use the platforms to get around this. Should I implement the platforms more? Also what about on FD? 

Another thing to add is, the falco always stays at the edge and whenever he grabs me he throws me off the stage, shoots a laser to lower my recovery, then he dairs me when I attempt to get back on stage, this is how he usually takes 3/4 of my stocks. Any advice on how I can work on improving these things?",2015-05-29 08:24:34,bDuke_,2

"A couple weeks ago you may of seen the new [Shine&gt;Nair Platform Warp](http://gfycat.com/VerifiableAliveAchillestang) that was discovered by Kitsune91, and documented by myself. While that tech is good (especially if you want to combo from the shine), it is incredibly difficult to be consistent. I believe I have found an answer for that, with this new tech guaranteeing you a setup within a 4 frame window, and allows other aerials to be used. This does require you to hit something, like a Platform Cancel.

So to do this tech, you must first perform a backwards shorthop then doublejump on airborne frame 11 or later (seen windows below). From the double jump you must aerial on a specific DJ frame, see details below.
______________________________________________
**Yoshis top platform**

**NAIR**

4 frame window to DoubleJump (11-14) | frame perfect Nair (5th DJ frame)

1 frame gap with no setup (15)

2 extra frame window to DJ (16-17) | frame perfect Nair (6th DJ frame)

**BAIR**

4 frame window to DJ (11-14) | frame perfect Bair (5th DJ frame)

**DAIR**

 4 frame window to DJ (11-14) | frame perfect Dair (4th DJ frame)
_____________________________________________________
**Fountain of Dreams top plat**

**NAIR**

3 frame window to DJ (11-13) | 2 frame window to Nair (5-6th DJ frame)

Extra 3 frame window to DJ (14-16) | frame perfect Nair (6th DJ frame)

**BAIR**

3 frame window to DJ (11-13) | frame perfect Bair (5th DJ frame)

**DAIR**

3 frame window to DJ (11-13) | frame perfect Dair (4th DJ frame)
________________________________________________________
Don't be scared by the frame perfect aerials, it is a very intuitive timing very similar to wavedashing and easy to be consistent at.

I am currently testing other stages and setups. It is not possible on Battlefield (except 1 double frame perfect nair setup from a backwards fullhop), but you can perform it from mid platform to top platform, havent fiddled around with it too much, but I found [this cool little trick](http://gfycat.com/FeminineGregariousHypsilophodon). It's a frame perfect DJ, but you can nair anytime, it doesn't require hitlag to work. It's kinda useless but it's kinda cool. If you were to hit something you would have to perform the nair at a specific time.

I am also positive other characters can use this tech as well, I tested Sheik a bit and she can do it with all aerials except dair ofc, fairly easily. Basically if they backflip from their backwards short hop then there is a high chance they have setups. Will edit if I find more.
__________________________________________________________

A good way to practice this is to use 20XX and set up the opponent on the top platform, then use the invincibility function (X + DpadUp) so that they don't fly away every time you hit them. It's a little easier on FoD, so you could try it there if you are having trouble.",2015-05-29 08:04:28,schmooblidon,4

I feel like he's going to run through a lot of Evo simply because so many US players are shit at the Yoshi MU. I have no clue how to play Yoshi personally beyond the Amsa videos I've seen so I have an idea but it would take more than 2 games to feel comfortable. Also he's really fucking good. He understands the game.,2015-05-28 12:28:59,TransatlanticFoe_,103
"""One top US placement"" is just plain wrong.  He got T9th at Apex 2014 and T5th at Kings of Cali 4.  He also had some crummy placements, but you can't attain multiple placements like that without being exceedingly good, no matter how unusual the matchup is (this does depend a bit on the character being average-ish--if there were a good-as-Fox character no one had any familiarity with that'd be one thing, *cougholderversionsofPMcough*, but everyone has been at least vaguely aware of Yoshi's toolkit for aeons and even with someone applying it he's still not a top tier character).

At Apex aMSa beat multiple players that he had played in tournament before, one of whom had soundly defeated him in their previous encounter (Lucky).  We have also seen players reach success before supposedly due to unfamiliarity with the matchup who turned out to just be really damn good (Axe) and players who lose to others in their region generally considered to be worse than them because of player familiarity.  People definitely know what Yoshi can do now if they didn't before.

aMSa is plainly very, very good at Super Smash Brothers Melee (and also at PM and Smash 4 if I'm not mistaken--certainly the latter).  I don't think it's unreasonable at all to place him that highly.  It's not unreasonable to place him below that, either.  He's definitely a wild card, but there's no real obvious reason to assert *any* player for Top 8 past the Top 6.  Who do you have placing high at Evo?  I'd be happy to play devil's advocate and tell you why you're wrong.

It's a little silly to be making predictions this early anyway.  Last Evo going into it I would not have picked Fly Amanita for Top 8--no offense to Fly, I just thought the odds were too high of him playing a good Peach or getting one of the god tier players early, and there were too many other good players I wouldn't have quite favored him versus.  Then brackets got published and I immediately picked Fly for Top 8 after all because I saw his bracket and thought ""Oh, I favor Fly in every match he needs to win to make Top 8.""",2015-05-28 13:02:22,Habefiet,98
"The thing is, despite everyone having time to adjust to the matchup, aMSa has been getting slightly better results with every USA super major. That should not be happening if all people need to do to beat him is ""learn the matchup"". 

I think he's going to get top 20 at Evo at least. A likely placement would be somewhere just outside the top 8 like 13th or something. Every major, aMSa shows up with slight adjustments in his gameplay that are hard for even the strongest of players to adapt to quickly enough to beat him. I expect him to continue this trend at Evo.",2015-05-28 12:53:08,PurpleKiller,35

"&gt;He had one USA top placement

Placing in the USA is hard. In other countries, Smash is not as big, so getting better is hard.

Not really, people still think he is a big gimmick, which can be true, because he doesn't place as well in Japan.

&gt;because he plays yoshi

Try playing that shit. So many 1 frame links that he does like it's easy.

&gt;He had one USA top placement and everyone now thinks he is a god among men because he plays yoshi

Falcon players have been trying to place that high for really long and they still can't. The fact that he can do that with Yoshi proves either that Yoshi is a top 9 character or that he is an amazing player. Your pick.",2015-05-28 13:26:35,wtvdd,27

There are also many matchups such as ICs that he does amazing in. Granted, I'm not saying he will definitely place in the top 12, but I like picking him as an early draft pick because I don't have to pray that he avoids certain matchups.",2015-05-28 16:26:23,daniellee912,8

He held his own vs. Mango and damn near won.  He beat Lucky.

A big part of it (IMHO) is the Bo3 ruleset EVO has. The better players will typically win Bo5 against gimmicky characters (see Amsa at MLG) but with Bo3 Amsa has a higher change of cheesing people out.

"I still don't think people are experienced enough in the matchup tbh. Knowing in theory what to do in a matchup isn't really enough, especially when the matchup tends to be kinda weird. Amsa still might do pretty okay based on the fact that nobody really has THAT much experience playing him.

"People tend to have recency bias; even myself, no one is immune to it. When  he got top 5 at Apex, everyone freaked out because of how unexpected it was, and people want to see him make top 8 again.

He also seems to get better and better everytime he comes to the US, excluding MLG and CEO

"1. Knockback scaling is just a percent value. It scales this value ((([p / 10] + [[p * d] / 20]) * [200 / w + 100] * 1.4) + 18). So if the scaling is small, that number grows slower. 

2. Each hitbubble has a base knockback attribute.

3. There's some formula. I don't know it because I just use Strongbad's knockback calculator.

4. Being hit while crouching reduces knockback by 1/3.

5. Launch speed is a function of knockback. There are other things that are determined by knockback like whether you're sent into tumble and other stuff. None of these values have units per se, they just have unspecific ""Melee units."" Each character has values for deceleration, gravity, and movement stuff.

6. Those don't affect knockback.
