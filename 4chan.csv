"Ask opponent to lie down on pavement

Deadlift him for 5 sets of 5

By set 4 or 5 your muscles should fatigue making you drop him harder on the concrete which will cause him to bruise and injure his back and head.

Also if you're not totally sure of your deadlift form, you can ask him to sit on the leg press machine, it'll probably be less harsh of a drop, but you don't want to end up hurting yourself during the fight.",2015-05-28 16:51:01,Sweet_Baby_Cheezus,1

South America sounds like a chill place. One plus side, cocaine is apparently extremely affordable and of very high quality. Still not worth it. Not even a visit, a week filled with sexy brown mega booties accompanied with non stop cocaine experimentation is somehow not enough to justify any and all contact with the entire continent, throw in Mexico too.  Sorry my brown colored friends but you lot get your major glaring problems in order and maybe I'll change my mind. 

BTW I imagine that the solution to a lot of the problems in south america are quite solvable.
