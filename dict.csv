"A solid, life-long friend.

Korean BBQ (not alone, this is only experienced with friends)

Georgia pulled pork BBQ. 

That red plastic egg that Amazon sells that you drop into boiled eggs while they cook and it tells you when they are done. If you've ever ruined a dozen boiled eggs, it's a worthy ~$5 investment.

London at Christmas time. I don't know why, the snow, the people dressed up nicely shuffling around buying gifts, the street decorations, the smells of good food, having a good pint in a pub watching all this through a frosted window listening to good music...

Wikipedia... the consolidation and indexing of human knowledge at the touch of a button. I try to read a few new articles each day. We've catalogued more than we can ever know! Read about tree frogs, space exploration, the smallest grains of sand or the wonder of arctic wildlife that seemingly defies nature and survives the harshest conditions.

The first time you fly and looking down at earth from 35,000 feet... seeing forming storm clouds, distant smoke, hills and great mountains reduced to mere bumps. It shrinks your world view.

Chicken souvlaki and dolmathes freshly made in greece. If done in Crete, bonus points for eating outdoors on essentially the remains of ancient venetian rubble and port buildings. 

Mechanical Keyboards.

I really love amazon prime. I know that sounds like a shameless plug, but buying whatever I need and having it the next day or sometimes two days later blows my mind. We've truly shrunk the world. What an amazing time in which we live.

Cooking bell peppers and Vidalia onions on the grille. Mix in some red and green peppers, sprinkle in some freshly squeezed lime juice, a little cilantro and freshly crushed garlic. That smell is the smell of homecooking, time well spent preparing food, care of family or friends, good times, and the awesome topping of good steak, or the best start of some good fajitas.

Rudy's BBQ sause. A little on some breakfast tacos, or some cut pork for lunch is unreal. 

Seeing the high mountain valleys of Switzerland. Lauterbrunnen, to name one. The literally postcard perfect green valley with meandering alpine rivers fed from thousand+ foot waterfalls cascading off the sides of sheer rock cliffs that line the valley floor... the towering white snowcpped peaks of the matterhorn, the eiger, the Zugspitz (sp?) hearing the crack of distant cannons fired into snowbanks to prevent avalanches, and the first time you walk on a glacier in shorts and a T-Shirt. That place is truly the most beautiful place I've ever seen, in over 40 countries in 4 continents.

Rock climbing the high desert in southern california. Joshua Tree national park. The sunsets there, the wildlife, the rock formations, the hardy desert plant life, feeling all at once in touch with some of the harshest terrain, and knowing that Brave souls once struck west through that terrain and depended on it for their very survival. 

Beer Pong with good friends and cute girls. 

Learning how to express your thoughts on paper. 

Helping someone learn how to do something for the first time, and seeing their expression the first time they get it right.

Lots of things are 10/10... in my experience the best 10/10 items are the ones you'll miss if you're not careful. Slow down, look around, try something new, take a pause to appreciate where you are, what you're seeing, what you're feeling. The best things are all around us.",2876

For example, 8¬≤ is 64. I know 9¬≤ is 81, but what if I didn't? I know 12¬≤ i 144, but what's 13¬≤? I don't have that one memorized.

Could there be some pattern that might be useful?

So I wrote out a bunch of squares, and looked at the difference between them, and figure out that if the first squared number was x, and the second squared number was y, then the difference was x+y. How cool is that? So to get 13¬≤, you could add 144 + 12 + 13 = 169.

Then I started trying to figure out how to express this in algebra. Surely someone had noticed this magic before, but maybe not - you never know!

After piddling around with x and y, I finally realized that you could also keep everything just to x - after all, it was x*x plus x+x+1. Or... x¬≤+2x+1.

I had just moved back to the states after living in Nicaragua for three years and was in a large public school.  These two kids were asking me where I had moved from and I told them Nicaragua, then one got a confused look on his face and asked ""Nigeragua? Where's that? They got a lot of black people there or somethin?""

At first I was confused as to why he would think that, then I realized his pronunciation...""umm, no...its in Central America, and it's full of NiCaraguans""

I thought that was as far as this was going to go, then they asked what I was doing down there. I told them my dad works for the American Embassy.

I saw their eyes light up with what I thought was recognition till they responded with ""oh man, those big ass hotels""

Me:um no, that's Embassy Suites, he works for the American Embassy, like the federal government

Them: ohhhhh...so I bet y'all got those big ass hotel rooms for free huh?

Went on from there to put together the idea of a massive sci-fi multiplayer FPS with immortal soldiers in a 5-way eternal conflict with high altitude ceilings for aircraft and a resource system.

This was about 10 years before Planetside 1 came out, doing virtually the same thing.

You're demanding space-to-surface combat in Star Wars: Battlefront, but I've had the concept going on paper for space combat between multiple planets for years now, where the entire planetary surface is rendered and available for combat, with a resource, crafting and social system.

"As someone that works in a nursing home (as a CNA not a nurse), I wouldn't recommend it. 

Very few people are good at taking care of the elderly because it's hard. It's physically hard to get people in and out of chairs or off toilets all day. It's mentally and emotionally exhausting to know that each day you go to work you aren't really helping someone get better, you're helping them stay alive just so they can eventually die. Not to mention you sit there and watch people slowly die knowing there's literally nothing you can do for them.

People who work in nursing homes can become incredibly cynical and I don't blame them one bit. A large part of the residents you take care of either are too far gone to give a shit about what you're doing or just aren't grateful at all; I've been bitten, kicked, punched, spit on, sexually assaulted, etc. and it drains you. The management doesn't care about you and the family members that come usually are pissed that you can't be in 8 places at once (though some of them can be absolutely wonderful).

"Antibiotic resistance is a problem, no doubt, but there are two HUGE misconceptions about this topic.

1.  Resistance is not permanent.  Bacteria not subject to antibiotics loses resistance over time.  This is because immunity to a specific drug has a genetic cost.  ...and since each drug class requires a different mechanism of resistance, the genetic cost is higher for each new antibiotic drug we create.  Meaning, as we diversify the drugs we prescribe and distribute, we'll be able to control resistance.  A big challenge to overcome here is pharmaceuticals selling huge quantities of human prescription antibiotics cheaply to commercial farmers for cattle/poultry/pigs/etc feed...

2.  The problem does not stem from doctors over prescribing drugs in the US.  Many strong antibiotics are available cheaply over-the-counter in 2nd world countries, and people will take them to solve almost any minor issue.   With the incredible increase in international travel over the last few decades, many of these resistant strains are imported from abroad.  A big challenge to overcome here is pharmaceuticals selling huge quantities of prescription antibiotics cheaply overseas where no prescription enforcement exists.

There is actually a lot of money being made while creating resistant bacteria.   Don't go blaming every mom that wants her kid's strep throat to be over.

"Scientist here.  One that I like to mention that few have heard about is how all the helium on Earth is going to run out soon, meaning no more helium, and this will have **huge** detrimental effects for many scientific and technological fields.

Background: despite being the second most abundant element in the universe, helium is really rare on Earth- it *cannot* be made artificially, and the gas is so light that it escapes into space fairly quickly once in the atmosphere.  So you can't really make more of it, and what little we have took 4.5 billion years to create, and half of which is a deposit in the USA.  But [Congress has mandated all the amount stored get sold by this year regardless of market demand](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/why-the-world-is-running-out-of-helium-2059357.html).  The current market price of helium is so cheap that you don't bother to recycle it, and of course do things like helium balloons and the like which are wasting it too.

Why is this an issue?  Well for ultra cold temperature science and tech, most rely on liquid helium to cool the instruments which is about 4 degrees above absolute zero.  You do this because at room temperature or even liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 Kelvin) the thermal noise is way higher, to a degree that can really matter if you are trying to capture a few photons from a faraway galaxy or superconductivity magnets in MRI machines.  

So starting in the next few years the price will suddenly be *way* higher, so hopefully people will start to recycle helium instead of just letting it escape... but most likely it's going to all be gone in the next 25 years.  And there is no way to get helium back once it's gone.  That will really, really suck.

Edit: As several people asked about the potential for asteroid mining, there is an even better, bigger rock out there to mine helium- the moon.  [China is already looking into the feasibility of this,](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/197784-china-is-going-to-mine-the-moon-for-helium-3-fusion-fuel) as it's also a great isotope of helium for nuclear fusion.

Edit 2: For those saying ""we'll just do fusion!"" no, this really isn't a viable option for the amount of helium we use on a daily basis.

Orally? Useless. But medical-grade Manuka honey actually makes a fairly good topical medicine that we use occasionally to help aid wound healing.

I personally don't use it very often in small animal medicine as some of my colleagues do, but I do use it fairly regularly in equine medicine, particularly for leg injuries which can take a long time to heal. It does a good job of helping keep the wound clean, is quite sticky so can easily be spread over the entire wound and similarly keeps flies off the wound itself. It's not my first choice treatment, but it does have the advantage of being relatively cheap compared to other wound treatments, so clients with horses facing months-long recovery for wounds often elect to use honey following the first several weeks.

"The sad thing is their wealth actually will shield them from its effects. When the warming hits our crop yields and rising ocean levels swallow up tiny island nations they won't be among millions of starving displaced people. The worst they'll face is losing their beach houses. 

Edit: I should have specified that I was talking about effects we'll see in the near future. Obviously money won't save anyone from catastrophic economic/civilization/environmental collapse.  But when rising grocery prices make it a struggle for me to feed myself on my very reasonable salary, the rich won't even notice. And then I'll probably be joining you all in the revolution.",395

"Addendum; at the time, there were a whole bunch of rich or important people who were telling us that everything was fine, and that nothing bad was going to happen.  In fact, they kept on telling us those things as everything got worse.  I guess they though being rich or important was going to keep them safe, or at least shielded from the effects of what was happening.  Or maybe they didn't like the fact that changing the way we do things could make them less rich and important, and decided they didn't care if things got worse.

Why yes, hypothetical future children.  I think that makes them monstrous and fucked up human beings, too.

EDIT: There are a few response posts I've made that further expand on this comment.  I'd appreciate folks taking a gander at them before hurling rhetorical stones.",832

"Honey is very hygroscopic, it pulls the water out of microbes that try to invade it and they die from dehydration.  This is its strongest antibiotic property and it is useless as a medicine since honey has to be diluted in water before it gets to the bloodstream.  Otherwise, it will dehydrate the patients cells.  Honey is a good dry preservative, but not a medicine.",396

"*as a young adult*... **VOIP**:

I thought, ""what if instead of the instead of the 50 telephone lines we have here in our office, we could just use the unused bandwidth from our internet T1s?"". Our MCI rep explained how this was impossible. He didn't know that MCI engineers (and engineers from all telcos) were already working on it.

Tuned just like a regular guitar, but an octave lower. That way, any guitar player could fake it on bass.

Why buy a water heater? All you need is a large insulated container, with a thermostatically controlled gas burner underneath!

"I had just recently moved back to the south and while at work we somehow got on the topic of men being somewhat similar to women, ( I think it was because a coworkers husband was recently diagnosed with breast cancer), I started to talk about chromosomes and how men kind of develop first as females, then the Y chromosome kicks in and we start developing male parts, so on and so on....
