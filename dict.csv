"Astronomer here!  I spent a little bit of time thinking about this, and your best bet would be to launch the satellite into an orbit &gt;700km from Earth or so.  See, the thing is if you are going for more than a thousand years around the Solar System out of Earth orbit you are subject to a *lot* of potential perturbations from multiple planets and the stellar winds from the Sun (which are not constant at *all*, especially over such a long time).  So you'd need to account for orbital corrections, but who's going to make sure their probe's thrusters are going to survive hundreds of years?  Kinda risky.

Instead, Earth orbit has the nice detail that *everything* eventually decays in Earth orbit that's orbiting nearby, partly due to the drag from Earth's atmosphere (that KSP players know well), but once again that dratted solar wind is a huge factor (which isn't in KSP).  [Vanguard I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_1), for example, is the oldest satellite in space and was designed to be up there for 2,000 years... but will ""only"" be up there for ~260 because the effects of the stellar wind were not understood at the time it was launched.  But these effects are really well known now, so a 1,000 year duration for our satellite should be doable.  Definitely to within a year or two.

The only issue is it would be really really *really* hard to say where exactly it landed on Earth.  So maybe stick a radioactive tracker on it so the future folks searching for it have a chance of finding the damn thing, as it's not terribly big and may evade radar systems.",2015-05-19 10:15:36,Andromeda321,242

"Astronomer here!  I spent a little bit of time thinking about this, and your best bet would be to launch the satellite into an orbit &gt;700km from Earth or so.  See, the thing is if you are going for more than a thousand years around the Solar System out of Earth orbit you are subject to a *lot* of potential perturbations from multiple planets and the stellar winds from the Sun (which are not constant at *all*, especially over such a long time).  So you'd need to account for orbital corrections, but who's going to make sure their probe's thrusters are going to survive hundreds of years?  Kinda risky.

Instead, Earth orbit has the nice detail that *everything* eventually decays in Earth orbit that's orbiting nearby, partly due to the drag from Earth's atmosphere (that KSP players know well), but once again that dratted solar wind is a huge factor (which isn't in KSP).  [Vanguard I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_1), for example, is the oldest satellite in space and was designed to be up there for 2,000 years... but will ""only"" be up there for ~260 because the effects of the stellar wind were not understood at the time it was launched.  But these effects are really well known now, so a 1,000 year duration for our satellite should be doable.  Definitely to within a year or two.

The only issue is it would be really really *really* hard to say where exactly it landed on Earth.  So maybe stick a radioactive tracker on it so the future folks searching for it have a chance of finding the damn thing, as it's not terribly big and may evade radar systems.",2015-05-19 10:15:36,Andromeda321,330

My definition of successful is ""being able to live the life that YOU want to live."" and if that doesn't involve other people that should be your decision to make. And when you accept that the social narrative isn't a real thing we need to take in to consideration it actually liberates us, when we don't think that ""only X kind of person can get Y kind of result.""

"Honest question, and I'm going to sound like a dick for asking, but here it goes. 

An acquaintance of mine suffers from chronic depression and anxiety. He's always down on himself. He tries hard to exercise and eat right, avoids drinking, sees a professional (who we think probably is terrible at his job), but has zero self esteem (but a lot of arrogance). He's overweight and feels unattractive and unsure of himself, but is arrogant about his intelligence. 

**How do I deal with him?** Awful question, I know. We frequently invite him to events, treat him with respect, think about him as ""part of the group"" even though he lives in another part of the state. He still manages to come to these events and while we're being friendly and directly engaging him, he still tries to shit all over everyone both in terms of being a dick and in terms of being self-deprecating. 

- He wanted a job at my company, and I was willing to go to bat for him. I asked him how his Excel data modelling skills were. ""Umm better than yours!"" He also corrects my language when I'm texting him about job leads. I wonder why he gets so many interviews but no job offers despite having an MBA...

- He will see a group of people talking about Game of Thrones, and blurt out ""A song of fire and ice"" spoilers. 

- He will go to women at parties and go ""ugh, seriously, on a scale of 1-10, how pathetic am I?""

We give this guy so many chances, and we can tell that he's depressed and anxious as fuck. When he's not being a dick, he'll often drive 200 miles to see us, get really anxious, and maybe 3 hours later at the start of a long weekend we all planned, he'll take of to go back home. 

What the hell can I do to make his day better and allow him to have a good time hanging out with us?",2015-05-19 08:43:06,nobody2000,15
"I could be totally wrong here, but I generally think someone who behaves that way needs to be called out on it. Maybe not in front of everybody, because you don't want to make his anxiety even worse, but if you can take him aside and just ask him why he does stuff like spoil shows for people or call himself pathetic in public, and tell him that his behavior is upsetting, that might get the ball rolling for him to change. Frame it in a way so that he knows you want to help him have an easier time dealing with people, because you want to be able to hang out and have fun together instead of being made to feel uncomfortable. I'm sure most of what he does is a manifestation of his own depression and insecurities, but that still doesn't excuse it when he's doing stuff that makes others upset or uncomfortable, so he needs to know that it's not okay to act that way.",2015-05-19 09:48:30,mfball,17

"I'm going to echo what others are saying about asking to hang out, but I'd like to add that it's often very difficult for people with depression and/or anxiety to make decisions for various reasons. Be aware of how you're phrasing things. 

""Do you want to go out to eat?"" is a very open-ended question. If I'm asked this, it's a huge can of worms of stress. I don't know where I want to go. What if you don't want to go where I want to go? What if it's crowded, what if it's too expensive, what if...

Meanwhile, ""Would you like to go get lunch at that new burger joint?"" isn't so open-ended. The decision is already made, so you're saving me the stress of choosing something that will make us both happy and you're saying that the price level of that place is acceptable. It also makes it much easier to make other suggestions and say things like ""I don't know, it's new so it'll be crowded. What about that sushi place across the street?""

Beyond that, resilience -- but not nagging. Depression makes it difficult to find the motivation to do things, and excuses are common. Accept no for an answer and don't needle or bully, but let your depressed friend know you do still legitimately want to hang out or talk to them. If they say no, ask when a good time would be. Ask them again a few days later, etc. There's no need to text the same question every day, but... The reminder that other people are still there and still desire to be around us helps a lot, as do options and time to mentally prepare for events. 

If you're depressed and your friends ask you to hang out and you don't feel like it, that's okay. But sometimes even when you don't feel like it, go anyway. I rarely feel like doing anything but once I actually go and *do* it, I'm quick to change my mind and I have a good time, depression be damned. Say yes sometimes. Let your friends drag you out. It's especially helpful in remembering how to enjoy things that depression has forced you to forget.",2015-05-19 04:56:45,scylladex,300
"&gt;If you're depressed and your friends ask you to hang out and you don't feel like it, that's okay. But sometimes even when you don't feel like it, go anyway. 

It's not always easy but I try to go by a rule of three. Someone asks me to do something once, it might just be in passing. I try to say yes, but sometimes I'm to deep in my own mental cesspool that I can't bring myself to. 

If they ask a second time I try to take it as it means they really want to hang out, makes it a little easier to get over myself. 

It can be counter productive, but when someone takes the chance and actually asks a third time it means to me that they are really trying to make it work. I try so hard to pull myself out because I know if I deny a third time the probably won't be a fourth. The post that sticks is when I can't and know that I'm destroying an opportunity by continually saying no. I've done it too many times.",2015-05-19 07:43:29,Soggy_Pronoun,53
"I have a friend I met who told me I may be depressed. Since then, I have sought help and am able to function on a daily basis. I am still working on the depression end of moving away from Netflix. My best friend is aware of my situation and rather than invite me to things, she has asked me to choose her over the other friend I mentioned earlier. I do not want to choose, nor should anyone be asked to do so by someone who cares about you. Then, she punishes me for my decision by not inviting me places or taking the initiative to be social. Please don't do this to someone with depression. Also, when I tell you that I consider killing myself, and you tell me you don't want me to do that yet you act like you could give a shit if I am around, do me a favor and try. One thing that hurts the most is taking the initiative to be social and not feeling like I am being included in the event or feeling like you could give a shit if I were there or not.

"Hey, I have an honest question...I've never been depressed, so I'm just trying to understand. Please don't think I'm being rude.

Does this apply to all forms of depression? I always thought that depression was due to a chemical imbalance in the brain. Maybe this starts because of a series of unfortunate events, maybe it doesn't...but the point is that once you are down, you're down, and that's why people get prescribed drugs. 

For example, depression was once described to me in terms of exercising. A healthy person might feel down one day, not feel like going for a run, not do so, and feel shitty. But if they do go for a run, their body will flood with endorphins and they will feel better, at least a little, no matter what is happening in their life. A depressed person, on the other hand, will get up, make them self run, but come back and feel exactly the same. The endorphins don't make you actually ""feel"" any better.

When it was explained like that, I understood what was so scary about depression, and why you can't just ""snap out of it."" I always thought it was a much deeper problem, that you can't just stop feeling depressed because depression makes you stop feeling the things you used to feel, and your usual pick me ups won't work because of chemicals in your brain.

There must be more that one type of depression, but I wonder how many types. It sounds to me as if you're describing exactly what I thought depression wasn't. It was my understanding that (and again, don't mean to be rude) if someone is depressed, they can't just find a new hobby and ""not let your emotions be the boss"" because the problem is a deeper, neurological one, and if they can, their problem wasn't clinical depression persay, more just like...sadness. I thought it was exactly this kind of thinking that made actual depression so dangerous.

I don't think I've conveyed all my thoughts properly, but I think I did it effectively enough to begin a discussion. Can you explain to me about different types of depression a little further?",2015-05-19 08:11:48,taco_tuesdays,160
"Thank you for this reply. I understand what you are coming from and I will also try my best to explain my position. First I would like to say that I am not a native English speaker, and in my language (Swedish) we would only use the word depression for the behavior you described. But when I read about this in english textbooks, they used depression much more liberate than Swedish does. 

The question you asked is actually splitting the psychology community in half, where some believe that depression can be caused by faulty brain chemistry and others don't. Me personally, I believe you can have faulty brain chemistry BUT never in isolation. Meaning that a person that is living exactly the kind of life he wants to live wouldn't get depressed. There will always be a real life problem connected to the depression.

That being said, yes, with chronic depression you can't snap out of it and the treatment required would be different each time. that is why I always recommend talk therapy. 

Medication is never the sole solution to the problem, the medication can help you so that you at least can get to therapy and do the things you and your therapist talked about, because the real solution is always there.",2015-05-19 08:24:36,AE-LifeAdvice,88
"I used to think like you. 

I was living exactly the life I wanted to live when my latest bout of depression hit. In a wonderful city with a wonderful SO and great friends, pursuing everything I had planned to and succeeding almost remarkably.

And then the dark cloud came out of nowhere. Over the course of about a week. I stopped enjoying the company of my friends, along with everything else. Where as before there was so much I wanted to do and learn, then I wanted nothing. Because nothing moved me, motivated me, gave me pleasure.

Chemical depression is real and ugly. I've had both kinds, but purely chemical depression CAN ruin someone living a wonderful life that they love.",2015-05-19 09:16:37,ispariz,142
"Agreed. I was in talk therapy for 7 years before I started taking SSRI's. I refused drugs for so long because of the stigma they have. During this time I lived a pretty decent life. Always had food, was a successful student, and even backpacked through Europe a couple times. But I also tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized. 

Finally I started taking the drugs because of an SO. He explained that my depression was ruining his life, even though I was being successful in not ending mine. It has changed my life! I'm alive AND happy. And I don't plan on going off them ever in my life (I am told that I have OCD, and SSRI's treat it wonderfully, but there is no cure because my brain structure is off).",2015-05-19 10:25:12,MUZcasino,30
"Yeah, his ""solution"" is pretty simplistic. My background is in psych (I/O though, not clinical) and my GF is wrapping up her PhD in the same thing. She is currently suffering from Major Depressive Disorder and I can tell you that ""just do new stuff"" doesn't really cut it. 
  
I think this is great advice for people in a ""rut"" but for those dealing with a clinical problem the level of oversimplification is outright damaging. Who knows how many people have read this and thought ""but I've tried all that, why do I still feel like life is not worth living?"" and felt *worse* because of it.",2015-05-19 10:35:04,ConsummateK,66

I'm really sorry I just unloaded all this shit on you stranger. Geez.",2015-05-19 11:36:04,cytogirl,27
"No need to apologize. Although I don't have personal experience I'm quite familiar with the struggle.
  
How long were you off of them? Depending on the meds, it can take while to get it entirely out of your system. Are you talking to someone? I would recommend a cognitive psychologist personally, and someone with a PhD. ""Therapists"" are a dime a dozen unfortunately so looking into their credentials is an important step. 
  
I advocate for the meds + talking to someone approach. If the meds aren't bringing nasty side effects, and they help you feel better, then personally I don't see any rush to get ""off"" of them. You don't see amputee victims being made to feel bad about their prosthetic. It's a legitimate medical issue, and should be treated as such. 
  
The toughest part is when you *know* you're being irrational (I've made the mistake of listing all of the awesome things in our life to my girlfriend) and also realize that knowing that doesn't help. There is a serious feeling of helplessness there. Because of that I think you have to define success as trying. As long as you are still working at it, making an effort every day, you have to give yourself credit and consider it another step in the journey to recovery. You never know when you're going to turn the corner.",2015-05-19 11:48:41,ConsummateK,5
"While everything you've said about negative reinforcement is valid, a real, objective problem isn't necessary to cause depression.  

Clinical depression resulting from a chemical imbalance can occur regardless of circumstances. Things that should be a source of positive reinforcement, such as exercising regularly or going out with friends, no longer are. Someone with a chemical imbalance that causes depression loses the ability to enjoy the activities they used to love. They may become withdrawn and inactive, but that's not just a lack of motivation or a negative attitude. It's a rational response when you derive no pleasure from living your life.

Pushing a patient like this to keep going through the motions isn't productive, because they are not capable of experiencing the rewards they should. Instead of positive reinforcement, they get *negative* reinforcement every time they make a genuine effort to be active and productive, because they're doing all the right things but still see no improvement in their mood. 

Speaking from personal experience, it can be incredibly frustrating to hear therapists and doctors recommend things like more exercise or a new hobby when you've already explained that these experiences can no longer make you happy.  The process of seeking help, doing what you're told and experiencing no relief is demoralizing enough the first time around. 

Worse, when a therapist or doctor is not mindful of this or is inclined to believe most/all cases of depression are circumstantial, it can turn into a feedback loop that worsens the patient's depression: 

* The patient seeks help. 
* The mental health practitioner looks for external causes and proposes lifestyle changes as a solution.  
* The patient can't identify a cause and derives no joy from going through the motions of a happy life. 
* The patient returns to seek more help. 
* The practitioner urges the patient to try harder and give the plan more time.
* The patient continues to suffer and makes no progress.
* The practitioner is reluctant to resort to antidepressants and instead suggests more talk therapy, more behavioral changes, and other non-drug strategies.
* The patient still makes no progress. 

And so on. If it goes on long enough, the patient may lose hope and start to disengage from the therapist/doctor or from treatment altogether. I've seen practitioners who made this even more miserable by implying that I wasn't trying as hard as I could or that I was being dishonest about having tried the ideas they suggested. It's all incredibly counterproductive for someone who needs medication to correct the underlying problem before other solutions even have a chance at helping.

**Edit:** It's also important to bear in mind that for a person with clinical depression, just reaching out for help and trying to get better can be a difficult step to take. With enough negative reinforcement (whether it was caused by real events or a chemical imbalance), it's easy to become convinced that treatment won't work.  Actually being in treatment for a substantial period of time without any improvement is absolutely devastating.  By all means, screen for potential real-life problems and suggest lifestyle changes before referring to them to someone who can prescribe drugs, but take patients at their word if they explain that their depression was not triggered by a particular event/problem and that even when they try activities that should improve their mood, nothing brings them joy.  When this happens, validate their concerns and acknowledge that medication may be the best solution.",2015-05-19 10:57:35,PurePerfection_,50
"Imo, depression is a biopsychosocial disease, and the severity of the depression dictates the initial treatment, I'd say the more severe the depression the more initiatite you should have to begin medication, to atleast make the person able to talk, I'm a huge believer in therapy though, but sometimes people need that key to unlock their mouth...And Swede here aswell, so I'm having some trouble describing exactly what I feel about this!",2015-05-19 08:58:59,Thergal,13

"I'm in love with a 28 year old woman who has been dealing with depression since around age 10. Toeing that line of ""being patronizing"" when I really just want her to be able to feel emotions other than ""nothing"" or ""hopeless"" is seriously the hardest thing I've had to mentally deal with in my life. Just the fact that it's not as simple as ""change your habits, change your thoughts and change your surroundings in order to change your mind"" for some.


I'm a highly physically affectionate and empathetic person so it kills me to feel like no matter what I do it's not going to help. Any mention of talking to someone is met with contempt and seen not as caring about her getting help for an illness, but as an attack on her character. I even have depression, and I've gotten better through CBT and medication (plus I work hard to maintain hobbies/a social circle/an exercise routine); but it's brutal realizing that depression isn't a ""one cure fits all"" illness.",2015-05-19 09:00:24,alczervik54,13

"Showing they care in some way.

Sending a text, talking to you, etc. Being depressed is a really lonely experience, kind of. You hold it all in and feel very isolated, and don't want to bother people with all your emo so you don't talk about it and it creates this weird wall.

A weird fog comes over you and you think that nobody cares about you, you're worthless, etc.

So people breaking through that and pulling you up out of it with a ""how are you doing"" or ""hey what's up"" or ""do you wanna go see a movie/get coffee/hang out"" is really awesome.

Also, when I am crying in the hallway or something, bringing me tissues or chocolate and keeping me company or something is infinitely better than asking me what's wrong or telling me it'll all be okay.

""What's wrong?""

""Err, I'm just depressed... for no reason... it's a condition.""

It's an awkward conversation... 

RL examples that happened recently when I was suicidal:

(1) Stepped out of the classroom to go cry in a corner (for no reason, just feeling too bad to hold it all in I guess), someone walked by and handed me tissues and asked if I wanted a hug (it's a women's college, so that may change the way asking people if they want a hug is perceived) and gave me some tissues.

(2) Someone handed me some sticker after I talked about my experience with suicide attempts in class (it was relevant to the class discussion, I don't just randomly bring up my problems in class) that says ""never ever ever give up"" and I still have it and think about it or read it when I am really sad and want to die.

(3) The same person at a different time came up to me with some scented oil or whatever and asked if I wanted some (to rub into my skin like perfume) because her mom always gave her some when she was upset and it calmed her down. I don't know if it was actually the oil that calmed me down or helped me, or if it was her showing she cared and not asking me/expecting me to explain exactly why I felt so bad, but it calmed me down for long enough for me to go to the computer lab and print out coloring pages of guinea pigs to distract myself from my emo-feelings so I could get through the next class I had.

(4) During the same crying fit as example number 1, I got all worked up again after a few minutes and started feeling a panic attack coming on, some random professor walked by and did asked if I was okay, I asked if they wanted the real answer or the comfortable answer (I dunno, my way of figuring out if people honestly want to know or not), they said real answer, I said no, they asked what's wrong (only situation in which asking that is not annoying, for me personally), I told them I was depressed and had to get back to class but couldn't because I was crying, she gave me a hug and gave me instructions on how to focus. 

She said something like ""you can make it through the next class, I'll help you out. Go into the bathroom and splash your face/eyes with cold water, look in the mirror and tell yourself you can make it through today, take deep breaths, and when you come out I'll wait for you and walk you back to class."" It was exactly what I needed in that moment. I don't really expect most people to be able to read the situation properly/know what to say beyond ""I'm sorry, do you want a hug?"" so it was really surprising and made me feel a lot better and actually helped me.

This answer turned out longer than I thought. These are just the things I find really helpful, other depressed people may not but in my experience many people also find them helpful.

All of these experiences happened at my university, though, which is a small women's college and therefore has this atmosphere of sisterhood where everyone cares about each other.

"Maybe it's just me, but when I am depressed there is nothing anyone can do to make me feel better. I'll get deep into a funk, and the only person who can bring me out of it is myself.

My wife is super sweet and super helpful and when I am depressed, she is so supportive and tries to cheer me up. It's the nicest thing, but it doesn't help at all. Depression isn't like that; it's not a simple sadness. And in fact, it can backfire. If someone tries really hard to make you feel better, and you *know* it should be cheering you up but it doesn't, that can feedback and make you feel even worse. You start to feel guilty on top of depressed, because you know you have no good reason to feel so shitty, and everything in your life is actually pretty great... but you just feel awful about it.

So I've only recently (past couple of years) learned how to manage my depression. Doing something I normally like doing does not help, but doing something I normally hate doing (like exercise or cleaning) does help... Getting something important but un-fun done will make you feel better, and because you're already depressed you can't really feel any worse about doing it. I try to force myself to change my scenery. Going on a walk helps a *lot*. Go outside and feed some ducks. Go on a drive to a new neighborhood where you don't know any of the streets. NSFW and maybe a little obvious, but masturbation helps a lot too.

I guess that doesn't answer the question about how do you help someone who is depressed... #1 is to not let yourself get upset when your offers to help are not met with enthusiasm. A lot of time the person can know in their mind that you are being so sweet and helpful, but be unable to feel the joy that should come with that knowledge. But if they see their feelings let you down, it will make them worse. My best suggestion is to take them on a walk, go feed ducks or whatever with them, just take them somewhere new and different that is out of their normal range of activity. Just *being* there helps. You know the cliche where you say, ""I'm here for you."" Well, sometimes that's really all you need to do.

He worked as a bin man through the 70's and 80's when many WW1 vets were obviously passing away and he said it was really common to find medals and photo's from the war and because he was finding so much of the stuff it prompted him to start his collection.  In particular he had a lot of photo's from the trenches that would not exist in any other form as they were just peoples private photo's.

""Sometimes they sell great things they don't have room for or want!""

""You mean junk.""

I begrudgingly followed along to avoid getting smacked and as my parents were looking through shitty furniture and wobbly tables, I noticed a few long cardboard boxes which were marked ""$1 each.""  As I opened it up, it was a ton of comics from the 1970s with some being from the 1960s.  As my heart was about to burst out of my chest, the old lady came over and said she used to read them as a kid.  Many of them weren't protected in those plastic sleeves you see today but most were in great condition.

""Comic books?  Aren't you too old to be reading comic books?""

I gave him the side eye and the old lady said that there are a bit too many to count and she would give me each box for $50 for a total of $150 for all three.  My parents still said it was the biggest waste of money on the ride home but it was my cash to do with what I will.

I got them appraised and the total worth was over $21,000 of which I probably still got ripped off.  The explanation was that the condition wasn't all that great.  Feeling a pang of guilt, I went back to the old lady's house a week later and gave her half saying that it was worth a lot more than I thought.

I own a copy of [The Hoople](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hoople) by Mott the Hoople that is terribly warped on one side (it curves upwards an inch or so) from being left out in the sun was it was new in the 70s. It doesn't even skip.

I've tested quite a few warped/uneven records over the years, some with extremely minor imperfections and others as bad as my copy of The Hoople, and I've found that they usually play on all but the cheapest setups. Unless his records melted to the point that they're basically no longer LPs, I think they'll do fine on passable equipment.

Records are not nearly so fragile as people say they are. It's hard to harm them significantly if you're responsible and they're generally fine to play even when misshapen. Sorry to go so long on this, but it's always been one of the biggest knocks on the format and it's not very well-founded.",2015-05-18 23:15:58,McSprad,189
"It isn't disastrous, but if it's warped in a certain way, it can file your needle down on edges that normally don't touch, and throw off the sound and the balance of the needle on the record.

"I have another one, because I'm a trashy individual. I pick up alcohol containers along public roads in Ontario. In a few hours of scavenging I can find about three hundred containers over about seven kilometers of ditch. Each container goes for ten or twenty cents, depending on volume, so this can add up quickly. I once made twenty two dollars for an hour and a half of collecting. It's fun, makes some cash under the table, and helps clean up the local area. The bottom line here is people literally throw money out of their cars and snow mobiles. That bottle of vodka you hucked at the stop sign? It was worth two dimes. Those ten beer bottles you threw into the pond? Those were worth a dollar. But hey, your loss is my gain, and I've been willing to work for it. 

Also, as a side note, Ontario apparently has a very serious problem with consumption of alcohol behind the wheel. Three hundred is a lot, guys. Clean up your act.",2015-05-18 21:44:45,Mr_Club_Soda,1737

"I browse the free section on craigslist a lot so I have a little experience picking up second hand things that people would otherwise throw out. The coolest thing I ever got was a lunch, beer and a friend.

STORY 

Some person wanted someone to just come hang out with them and bring as many people as they like. They claimed to just be lonely and needed friends. Took 2 buddies to go chill. We sat around and watched some TV while chatting, he took us all out to lunch, we had some beers and we remained friends afterwards and he was regularly invited to social gatherings. Really chill dude. He had just moved to the city from across the country and just didn't know anyone. Strangest thing, though, the guy had no hobbies. Like, none. He spent literally all of his time working, coming home and watching TV. His only thing close to a hobby was jogging and watching movies. He basically picked up the first 3 hobbies he came in contact with from his new found friends so he was like a blank slate. He picked up PC gaming from me, car guy stuff from another friend and comic books from another dude. Now his house has a nice gaming PC with triple monitors, a moderate comic book collection with some cool comic book posters and he drives a sweet car that he often works on in his garage. Turns out when you have no hobbies for like 3 years, you end up with a bunch of extra money to spend on hobbies. I can't even imagine our group of friends without him now, it seems like he has been with us forever now. You can't buy a friendship like this.",2015-05-19 07:59:18,SC2_Bench,133

Before I left I acquired a massive a amount of nerf guns, and toys for my kids (after I washed them) and copper/brass/batteries and motors to be scrapped was always a bonus. When times were rough I could pull and extra 40-100 dollars in scrap a week,  by taking a backpack full home at a time.

Edit: my favorite items; the iPad was a cheap fixed I spent 2.00$ on a new screen, a Greek bouzouki which I break out every now and then, and plenty of old school gaming consoles plus last gen, games plus peripherals.

If it wasn't for scratches (and even some sand embedded in the screen), it would be worth ~$1000. In this condition it fetched ~$600 on eBay. Yaaay.

It was Toshiba. I kind of trust Toshiba laptops since then.",2015-05-19 06:53:03,tupungato,16

"Walt's pre-cancer life makes absolutely no sense. It actually makes it really hard to enjoy re-watching the show. I can't come up with a logical manner in which that character would end up in that situation.

We know Walter left Grey Matter because of a falling-out between Gretchen and Eliot.

We know at some point he jot a job at Los Alamos National Labs (where he met Skylar)

We know he got a job at Sandia National Labs and moved to Albuquerque. (As an Albuquerque resident I can attest to the fact that those jobs pay *very* well. Walt certainly would have made more than enough to provide for a family, not to mention premium health insurance)

We know that **for some unknown reason** he became a high school chemistry teacher who had to work at a car wash to put food on the table.

Walt's story has a huge gaping hole in it. The main character's backstory is completely ignored just because it can't be adequately resolved. It doesn't ruin the show; it just bothers the heck out of me. It makes Walter feel like a contrived and inorganic character to me.",2015-05-19 09:14:51,Verodimus,112
"I know exactly what you mean.

Back in the first season there's an episode where Walt is attending a gathering at Gretchen and Eliot's house (I believe it's the first episode with them). He's speaking with another guest and mentions that he teaches, so the other guest asks what university Walt teaches at and Walt has to awkwardly avoid answering.

From the first time I saw that scene, my immediate question was ""Why ISN'T Walt a university professor? With his credentials, why is he teaching at a public high school?""

I was hoping they'd eventually shed some light on that, but it never came up again.",2015-05-19 11:38:17,Hardtopickaname,53
