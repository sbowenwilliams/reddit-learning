"In Ireland, during the Iron Age (c. 2500 years ago), the inauguration ceremony of a new High-King involved the High-King-to-be publicly engaging in copulation with a female horse. The purpose of this inauguration rite was as a ritualistic method of ensuring fertility for a kingdom. Horses played a central role in Iron Age society and were highly respected. 

Iron Age Ireland was a very interesting period.

**EDIT/counter-argument for /u/Foreverfun's point:** As with most things in pre-history the further you go back the harder it is to prove things, but this doesn't mean the evidence of horse worship, and other accounts of similar practices elsewhere in the world is completely irrelevant because of one written account, *assumed* to be propaganda by an individual. Admittedly we can only speculate with the evidence we are given but this generally accepted among the archaeological community. So the argument for propaganda is a weak one.
Additionally, England didn't invade Ireland until much, much later, at least 500 years later. At this point Ireland had begun to practice Christianity and such acts were frowned upon.

"&gt;There are some things which, if the exigencies of my account did not demand it, shame
would discountenance their being described. But the austere discipline of history spares
neither truth nor modesty. There is in the northern and farther part of Ulster, namely in
Kenelcunil [Tyrconnell], a certain people which is accustomed to consecrate its king with
a rite altogether outlandish and abominable. When the whole people of that land has
been gathered together in one place, a white mare is brought forward into the middle of
the assembly. He who is to be inaugurated, not as a chief, but as a beast, not as a king,
but as an outlaw, embraces the animal before all, professing himself to be a beast also.
The mare is then killed immediately, cut up in pieces, and boiled in water. A bath is
prepared for the man afterwards in the same water. He sits in the bath surrounded by
all his people, and all, he and they, eat of the meat of the mare which is brought to them.
He quaffs and drinks of the broth in which he is bathed, not in any cup, or using his
hand, but just dipping his mouth into it round about him. When this unrighteous rite
has been carried out, his kingship and dominion has been conferred.97

"The relationship between Heydrich and Canaris is actually one of the most fascinating of the War, if not history as a whole. Heydrich served under Canaris as a naval cadet and the two became very close friends. Heydrich lived next door to the Canaris family for some time and was a regular fixture at their weekly dinner parties. The two were well known among the German elite for playing musical duets with one another at small gatherings at their houses. At times, they would go riding in the mornings and have long conversations about the state of Germany. Canaris openly wept while attending Heydrich's funeral. Yet, despite their seemingly close friendship, the two were very much rivals. Heydrich constantly sought to take over Canaris' Abwehr, while Canaris blackmailed Heydrich with photographic evidence of his Jewish ancestry and noted in his diary that Heydrich was a dangerous fanatic. A real fascinating interplay, considering the positions of both men. 

Edit: It's worth noting that Canaris could very well have been following the tried and true strategy of keeping your friends close but your enemies closer. That being said, Canaris became close friends with Heydrich before the cadet rose to prominence, so it's entirely possible that there was general affection between the two of them.",2015-05-20 12:01:23,TheHuscarl,1

While he's one of the few Nazis to have suffered a satisfyingly lingering, fucked-up death (if schadenfreude is ever acceptable it's acceptable for Nazis, right?), he would ride his green Mercedes around Prague without an escort quite regularly, allowing his assassins to ambush him and throw a grenade into the back seat, I believe a piece of engine-shrapnel or something lodged in his guts causing an agonising death.

1. If you were a senator or a wealthy man, it was normal to have male lovers. If you didn't, you were seen as strange. However, you could only be the ""top"": if you were the ""bottom"", you were also seen as strange.

2. When Julius Caesar was a young man in the navy, he was captured by pirates. When his ransom was paid and he was released, he swore he would find them and kill every one of them. Five years later, he found them, captured them, took back the ransom money, and crucified every one of them along the Greek coastline, as a warning and a display of his power.

- First of all, there was the Roman god [Priapus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priapus), who had a giant penis.  His job was to impale people with said giant penis who stole produce from gardens- they found frescoes of Priapus in Pompeii near gardens as a warning for those who might get the wrong idea.

- There was a Greco-Roman god(dess) [Hemaphroditus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphroditus)- where we get the word from today of course- who was half man and half woman.  S/he was the child of Mercury and Venus.

- Speaking of Pompeii, if you ever visit one of the interesting things there is you can visit the old brothel from 2,000 years ago.  Not only are there frescoes on the walls (to either give clients ideas, or to show what was available, no one's quite sure), but the walls were filled with graffiti advising which prostitutes had STDs and the like.
