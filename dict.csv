"Astronomer here!  I spent a little bit of time thinking about this, and your best bet would be to launch the satellite into an orbit &gt;700km from Earth or so.  See, the thing is if you are going for more than a thousand years around the Solar System out of Earth orbit you are subject to a *lot* of potential perturbations from multiple planets and the stellar winds from the Sun (which are not constant at *all*, especially over such a long time).  So you'd need to account for orbital corrections, but who's going to make sure their probe's thrusters are going to survive hundreds of years?  Kinda risky.

Instead, Earth orbit has the nice detail that *everything* eventually decays in Earth orbit that's orbiting nearby, partly due to the drag from Earth's atmosphere (that KSP players know well), but once again that dratted solar wind is a huge factor (which isn't in KSP).  [Vanguard I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_1), for example, is the oldest satellite in space and was designed to be up there for 2,000 years... but will ""only"" be up there for ~260 because the effects of the stellar wind were not understood at the time it was launched.  But these effects are really well known now, so a 1,000 year duration for our satellite should be doable.  Definitely to within a year or two.

The only issue is it would be really really *really* hard to say where exactly it landed on Earth.  So maybe stick a radioactive tracker on it so the future folks searching for it have a chance of finding the damn thing, as it's not terribly big and may evade radar systems.",2015-05-19 10:15:36,Andromeda321,242

First what I do is get fantastically rich by selling tickets to the discovery of the 5 inch metal cube in 1000 years. I sell these as ""pre-orders"" with the bonus that you'll get a free pirate themed skin for the metal cube when it's found. I'll also include some optional 3 inch and 4 inch cube DLC (downloadable cubes) for all pre-orders. 

After that I use my vast fortune to invest in replacing my entire body cell by cell with robot nanomachines that will allow me to live for another 1000 years. I make especially sure to upgrade my skin to be like titanium and my ass to be just a little more spacious. 

At this point, all that's left to do is shove that cube right up my ass, and wait out the Millennium.",2015-05-19 08:07:15,FoieyMcfoie,1878
