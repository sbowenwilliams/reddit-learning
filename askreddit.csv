"I was living with my parents. I was 17. They told me to leave, then tried to stop me from leaving. I have been in an abusive relationship with my mom and my stepdad for years. Friends helped me load the car, that was 12 years ago. Never been back.",2015-05-28 21:21:51,ToastnEggs,3244
"Kinda late, but I'll share my story.

I grew up in Foster Care and all the homes I lived in either were abusive or run in a ""business"" (collecting cash to house kids) format.

My actual mom was a very heavy drinker and was abusive (hence being in Foster Care). As an adult, we had a very good relationship. She was proud of me, impressed with my work ethic, and amazed that I got a fully paid for education via scholarships at the state university.

Everything was going swimmingly until I started to ""do better"" than my immediate family. They started to think I had abandon them, and that I was ""too good"" for them once I started pursuing my education.

The last conversation I had with my mother and sisters occurred on Thanksgiving, 2011 when I drove 3 hours to sit down and have our first legitimate family dinner in several years. I showed up, my mom was drunk, and my sisters were incoherently intoxicated on narcotics. My sisters yelled at me for ""abandoning the family"" and called me unforgivable things. My mother said to me ""I hope you achieve all of your dreams, lord knows you've abandon ours."" I got up from the dinner and left. I spent the entire drive back home, for 3 hours, hysterically sobbing. I haven't talked with them since. I know it was bitterness, and the drugs talking, but it really shattered me to the core.

My mother passed away this last year, that dinner was the last time I ever saw her or spoke with her. Both of my sisters were incarcerated at the time, so I flew home to clear out her estate. She didn't have anything but a mountain of bills, and a house full of items to sort through. I donated almost all of it to Goodwill. While sifting through her belongings, I did find a lockbox though.

The lockbox contained her wedding ring from my late father, and some photos of my sisters and I as kids; perfectly preserved. It also had a single note inside, which was addressed to all 3 of us, with corresponding paragraphs dedicated to us. My paragraph said:

""Daniel, words cannot describe how sorry I am for how much I have hurt you. It has eaten at me every day for the last 10 years. I drink because I wish I could've been the mother you deserved. You are the strongest man I have ever met. I'm sorry. You deserve so much more than I gave you. I love you with all my heart. I hope someday you can forgive me.

Mom""

It destroys me inside to know that mom died thinking that she didn't mean the world to me. If I'm being honest, I started drinking very heavily after she passed. She died thinking I didn't love her with all my heart. I carry her Driver's License in my wallet, above mine, so that every time I take it out I get to see her; but more importantly, so that she can see me and know that I'm always right here.

Anyway, that's my story, reddit. Thanks for reading.",2015-05-29 02:19:19,DaedricDanny,1555
"Sort of.
My cousin went for a walk once.

He was dating this woman, who just an awful human being.  She got pregnant, swore it was his, and once the kid was born the state went after him for child support, as he wasn't on the birth certificate, even though they were living together.

Anyways, the paternity test came back showing it wasn't his, and she flipped her lid.  Just lost it.  He asked her to calm down and said he wanted to take a walk to cool off.  He left everything he owned, minus the clothes on his back and his wallet, and went for a walk that he never came from from.  A few years back the kid found him, he was 16 or 17, and went on some giant rant about him being a bum and a punk ass and whatever other nonsense.  My cousin told him he wasn't his dad, the paternity test showed that, and he had no idea why she told him he was the father and abandoned them.  Kid left a whole helluva a lot more confused then he showed up I think.

I literally drove for 12 hours and showed up at a friends house 5 states away and asked if I could crash on his couch. I called my boss and said I wanted to quit work. He was pretty cool about it, he knew my girlfriend, and actually set me up with a job in my new city. I have never spoken to my ex since.

"Lived in an abusive house with my mom. Got a job after college and in 3 months rented an apartment and went home. Took a garbage bag full of clothes and booked it. 

She didn't want me leaving because she was talking all of my money. She would take my car when I didn't pay her my full pay check. I had to resort to pulling fuses when I parked because she would hide my car on different streets trying to get me fired. Even in college I had finals to graduate and took my car and I had no way to get there. Had to rent a car just to take my finals. 

God...the stories I could tell...

Anyway, waddled in the apartment with my garbage bag and nothing else slept on the floor and for the first time felt peace. 

Now have a decent job, house, wife and a kid.

On one hand, I have no memories of him (I was too young). And I am very sympathetic to mental illness, and suicidal ideation. I have had bouts of serious depression in my life.

On the other hand, his absence, the lack-of-dad, left a huge gaping hole in my life. 

The strangest part is when I turned the age he was when he killed himself. I'm 36, and I'm older than my dad ever was. And I still feel young, like I have many years ahead of me.

I wish I had had the opportunity to know him. Everything I know about him is someone else's memory.

"Parents were split and hated each other and would always put me in the middle. The drugs and alcohol they were both doing didn't help.

Got kicked out of each of their places and went back and forth over some shitty circumstances involving them wanting all of my money to live with them, then playing the guilt card on each other that they took me in when the other kicked me out. 

Got a steady retail job that I had to work 6-7 days a week at odd hours to get full time. 2 weeks before christmas mom said her place wasn't a truck stop and I couldn't come and go at all hours of the night and that I had to leave. Heard similar from her before and didn't want to go to dad's again so I called some family and they all refused to take me in because my mom had called and told them I hit her. Since I was still in the same house I told her she was a horrible person, but an even worse mother, and left. 

Grandma knew parents were crazy so she helped me as much as she could. Still get phone calls/emails/Facebook messages asking me when I'm ""going to stop being a bitch so we can be a family again.""

Have seen both since. Invited some ""friends"" through Facebook to things that they in turn invited my parents to. Finally nutted up and told them both to get the fuck out of my life. Mom still leaves me drunk/high/crying voice mails in the middle of the night either telling me she loves me or that I'm all that's wrong with her life. Dad sends me emails telling me to get the stick out of my ass because I'm still his son.

Still spend time with my grandma. Friends parents mean more to me than my own ever did.

Now I've got a full time job, an awesome dog, working on doing better in life in general, and trying to move into a place solo.

Blood is not thicker than water.

Will never speak to either of them again if I can help it. No regrets.",2015-05-28 22:44:31,beeraduh,959

One night, I just packed the essentials into my backpack, walked to a train station and got on a train to Newport News, VA from Pasco, WA. No one knew I was gone until 3 o'clock the next morning.

"Throwaway for good reason. I've always lived in an abusive home, both mentally and physically and never saw a proper way out. I started working at 14 years old in a convenience store for 8 dollars an hour and hid all of the money I made in a locked container in a nearby wooded park area. I did this because my parent would have taken my money if they knew I was working at all. By the time I turned 18 I had close to 10 thousand saved up and had finished high school. I was supposed to start university that year but early on in the summer I waited until my parents went out to work, found and took all of my documents, unenrolled out of the University program I was supposed to be in and left. 

I took a bus to Alberta and i've been living here since doing labour, it's been a year and a half and they haven't searched from me yet, not that i'm aware of at least. How is my life now? I'm poor, barely getting by but at least im living alone and happier than i was before. 

Edit: First of all I want to thank all of you for the kind words and support that you've written to me in this thread. Originally I wasn't even going to write this because everytime I think about it, it brings me on the verge of tears. It's definitely something I try to avoid discussing in real life.

"My father just walked out on us when I was nine, walked out on everything. Racked up a load of debt before he went without my mother knowing, through a gambling habit he had which we didn't know about until immediately after and the hounding from the people/companies he'd borrowed money from. Some of them were the kinds of people you didn't really want to owe money to, and the next few years were kinda rough.

To add to that my mother got sick around the same time and ended up unable to leave her bed for a few years, I think the illness was caused or at least exacerbated by the shock of his leaving. Not going to lie, it was really rough. I ended up getting home schooling as they were afraid that he'd show up and pick me up from school one day, and after a little while of that my confidence was so drained that I avoided school as much as possible.

Police were looking for him and eventually found him after a year or two in a town ~200 miles away, but he didn't want to get in contact with anyone and nothing came of it. He was an ex-policeman so I guess he knew what to say, or something.

Then a few years later we got a phone call from a lady who had found his address book, informing us that he had died and she was looking for his next of kin. It ended with us traveling to where he had been staying, to find an elderly lady he was basically bleeding dry financially.

Some of the stories he'd been spinning to manipulate people were incredible. People there thought of him as a hero, he told them about how he'd started a new life after nursing his sick wife with cancer until she passed away. How my brother had been inspired by his story and was working as a doctor abroad, and in his fantasy I had never actually existed.

I can't really say I'm angry about it. I grew up afraid that I'd end up like him, but I think when you're exposed to something like that as a child you can either see it as an example of how to live; or you can look at it and do everything in your power to avoid becoming it.",2015-05-28 22:33:20,Goatbrush,406

"Left my family close to 5 years ago to move to California to start a new life. I was 400lbs, living a lifestyle of prescription drugs and drinking at 17 with my family.

I live on my own now and manage an office selling printer parts and various other money makers online. I started my own business last year and have been paying out of pocket to continue school here because the college I went to back home wouldn't release my transcript. I've lost a great deal of weight and am away from any unhealthy addictions. My family is for the most part very cross with me. My mother died two years ago nearly exactly.

"Growing up I was handed around from family member to family member. My parents were divorced my mother was a sociopolitical liar. My mom bounced me from relative to relative because she thought I was ""just like my father"" and hated that her youth disappeared quickly after having me and then my sister. 

As the years set in the abuse got worse and worse. It got more physical. Then she married a crazy former marine and things continued to escalate as I reached my teens. 

One time she hit me hard enough to chip a tooth. That's when I had enough. I called the cops. She sent me to my grand parents house. They had never been abusive until then. 

One afternoon mid summer they went to work and I had my girlfriends dad (a veteran cop) pick me up, when he arrived I was in bad shape but sitting on the porch with all my stuff in a bag. Mad as he was as an officer, he respected that I didn't want to involve the cops, I just wanted out. 

He let me stay with them, his wife, and his daughter (my gf). I finished out high school living with them. He and I fell away from each other during college, but Randy (her dad) I still respect to this day. 

Years later I would up and leave my home town on a whim with a car load of stuff leaving EVERYTHING behind with no warning and leave for Colorado. Just to free myself from the perpetual cycle of going no where in life. 

I now make $50,000 a year. Single and a Self made man. I lived in fear I wouldn't ever make it. But I'm 30 and I've made it, at least in my mind.",2015-05-28 22:30:20,secretcolorado,957
"American that moved to Australia for 2 years. Got a girl pregnant. Fell in ""love"". Saw her for the horrible person that she really was, but stuck it out. After the baby was born I had to be sure he was mine. The test came back showing no paternal match. I confronted her. We fought, she swore up and down it was a bad test. 

Wanting to believe it, I scheduled another test for the 3 of us to go in. $800 later, 2 days before the test, she played dumb and said she never agreed to that. Told me to get out of their life, and that her child was not a science experiment. I stayed with a friend a couple days then came back. She acted like nothing happened, and wanted to just move on. Another test was no longer an option in her book.

It was the hardest decision of my entire life, and it still makes me sick to think about...a week later I scheduled a flight back to California. I've been back for 4 years now. We had talked a bit over the year after I left, but just went back to her wanting to fight. After some anti-depressants and heavy drinking, I'm finally starting to feel whole again. I look at the world very differently now.

Anyway one day after being out at a friends house and hanging out all over the city for a couple days I finally came home and things around my house were just tense and I felt like nothing and like I would never get out from under this.. weight.  So I just started packing some stuff.   As I was leaving I remember I was coming out of my room with a Bag. This wasn't unusual because I would often take a bag with me when Id be gone to a friends house, but today, my dad was standing at the top of the steps just looking down at me. I remember very vividly , him standing there with his hands in his pockets kind of looking at me then looking away and he quietly just asked.

""where you going son?""

I just looked up like everything was normal and just said "" Im going to so and so's house""

He nodded slowly "" when ya com in back?""

I shrugged slowly "" I don't know dad""

Somehow he knew. I could feel it.  I never came back home, days turned into weeks and months and then years.   I could tell he knew.  It makes me so sad now when I think of it. Like I tore his heart in two. He has never been a very expressive man, but I could just tell how sad he was.  I needed this though, I needed to go off on my own and suffer the real world and grow up some.

"I did this, basically.  Told my parents I was going for a hike in the woods for a few days, instead took a flight to europe and joined the French Foreign Legion. They figured I was dead for a few weeks but eventually they figured out what I had actually done.

It's been almost 2 years, and I'd still rather not see them ever again, but one of these days I'm gonna have to go back and see all my younger brothers who still live there.  

As for why...it's a long story...I didn't have the greatest childhood.  Basically I decided I had nothing better to do and life was boring as hell, so I might as well do something stupid or crazy.  So I just left and never looked back.  Whether or not I'm better off now than I was before is debatable, but at least I can say I've done something with my short little life.

**EDIT** Because everyone keeps thinking I just up and left for no reason, here's a bit of background info on my life.

Parents were/are religious fanatics and complete narcissists with their own special brand of Christianity.  They home schooled me my entire life until I was 17, at which point they kicked me out due to religious disagreements.  

I managed to survive for around half a year by myself.  Unfortunately I was kinda lacking in the life skills department.  Basically until I left at 17, I never had any friends, never left the house without my parents, and had no diploma or any other record of me doing school. 

I also found myself kinda...lost without someone yelling at me all the time telling me what to do.  So I figured I would join the military.  Just do as I'm told, not have to worry about bills or food or anything.  Perfect.  Unfortunately my national army told me to wait 2 years and I have no patience at all so the next logical step was obviously to join the FFL.

So I didn't last long by myself, ended up coming crawling back to them and staying with them until I turned 18.  But I wasn't idle.  I saved up money,  stole all my documents from the lockbox where they kept them, and bought a plane ticket. 

And so here I am now.  Halfway round the world, speaking a different language and protecting a different people.",2015-05-28 17:13:04,SirAwesomely,2630

"I have never left, but my brother has. One morning, two years ago, I woke up with a killer hangover. Rolled over in bed, checked my phone and saw several missed calls and a couple of voice mails from my mother and sister, along with a text message from my dad, ""call me."" 

The first voicemail was from my sister, sobbing through the phone, she said (for the sake of the story, let's call my brother Tom) ""Tom just tried to commit suicide... He wrote us all letter and... And.. Just call me please"" 

Whoa. This can't be real.

Then my mom's voicemail. ""Tom attempted suicide last night, we haven't been able to reach him, but we suspect he might be heading your way. If you see him, call the police, we need to make sure he is safe.""

Oh shit. This is definitely real. We all somewhat suspected depression from him but this was unexpected. Anyways, I got out of bed and put some clothes on.

He had mentioned earlier in the day (around lunch time, via text) that he was going to grab a Redbox movie and some milk on his way home, so I didn't need to wory about it. So I waited a bit. Then decided to text him a few times, no response. Call him, no answer. I suddenly get this sinking feeling. I went and checked the closet...all his stuff was gone. He left.

Ohhhhhhhhh and did I mention it was my birthday too? :( Ugh.",2015-05-28 22:18:26,GoodbyeDoggie,680

"I don't know if this counts, but when I was about 19 I was in a shitty position. All of my friends were doing meth regularly, I had put out thousands of dollars to bail friends from jail and to try to help them out, the girl I was dating was lying to everyone she knew about our relationship.
My uncle called me in the middle of all this and offered me a job on the other side  of the country. I had my car packed and was headed there within 12 hours. I heard from the girl I was dating about 2 weeks later, she called crying telling me she went to my house and I wasn't there and wanted to know where I was. I told her I had moved and she told me it wasn't my choice to make, that I should've consulted her. I never heard from any of the people I had considered friends. I heard some of them went to jail, some had kids, some disappeared. I moved back to the town I left about 5 years later and everything has been relatively ok since then. Sometimes I see people I used to know. And sometimes they recognize me. But mostly I keep to myself and spend time with better people than those I left years ago.",2015-05-28 22:28:02,Capappy,37
"Went for a weeks holiday in Ireland, accidentally left the week before the one I had booked off of work due to a mix-up(in my brain).

That was in 2001.  :)

Been back to visit intermittently, and my parents/family were cool with it.  Ireland is home now, though I have travelled a bit and lived in a few other countries briefly in the last 6 years.

"Well, I lied to my parents that I was going to live with a buddy a few miles away from my California hometown when I got out of high school. I worked all summer to earn as much, and save as much, as possible.

I met a wonderful girl who lived across the country.

Summer ended... and I moved to New York City. For four years my family still thought I lived just a few miles away from Santa Barbara. In that time I moved in with her, we both finished college, and began my career.

My parents met my wife just before our wedding. When I came clean my dad said, ""No shit? We'll kid you've done well for yourself, and if you let this good woman of yours get away I will find you and kill you.""

My family was cool. I left because my hometown had NO opportunities unless I wanted to go into construction or lettuce picking. No exaggeration.

I'm now a staff VP at that same Fortune 100 company (20 years so far). Totally worth it.",2015-05-28 22:04:41,StarbuckPirate,629
"I left Tacoma, Washington (U.S.) and went south to Coos Bay, Oregon. I left friends, a girlfriend, some family I'm not very close to. I'm not sure why. I've ditched out a number of times to several different places. I just get tired of the same shit for too long. I don't have any illusions that my problem won't be waiting for me when I get where I'm going but for awhile I feel like a load has been lifted. 

  Part of it is that I've said and done things that I am not proud of or that I am embarrassed or ashamed of. For that and for other reasons I make my bed but then I get sick of lying in it. Besides, who doesn't want a fresh start? 

  One summer I had an anxiety attack which I didn't believe was a real thing until it happened. That turned into a whole year of just living in fear of another attack and that fear perpetuating more attacks. I really believe that everything caught up with me. I'd packed away too much and I imploded. Not fun. 

  Fast forward to January 11th, 2012. I checked myself into treatment, got clean, met a nice girl nine months later who is in recovery too. Today I have over three years (she has five). I am back in school and paying off my student loans (blew them on partying). I take medication for anxiety, which I *never* thought I would do because I think society is over-medicated and blah blah. Things are going good. Maybe it's because I am getting older (29) but I just don't feel like running anymore. At least not right now I don't. 

  I spoke to Alexandria (the girl I split on) again. She still lives in Tacoma and she is okay. She was hurt and confused but she has since got her revenge on me which I think cheered her up. Good for her. I would have preferred forgiveness but I'll take what I can get.

  Right now I'm somewhere near Seattle in a nice quiet apartment building full of old people. No sirens. No tweakers. Once I started facing my life, good things started happening. It's hard sometimes to maintain perspective. I get angry about stupid things but I don't blame others, I don't punch holes in my drywall and I *don't* run from things. Yahoo for me.",2015-05-28 20:58:31,_graboid,271
"I know this is really long, but... I felt like getting it out of my system.

I know I'm late and probably nobody will see this, but I thought I'd write it up anyway. Throwaway because I don't want people cross-referencing my post history with the information in this post and finding out who I am. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I don't want to be found.

To start off with, I'm a 27 year old woman. My mother died due to complications while I was being born. I have two older brothers and my father (a lawyer) remarried when I was 3 or 4, to a woman who come from a fairly well-off family, who had never done any real work in her life.

My father and his wife were abusive. So were my two older brothers. One of my earliest memories is what must have been my fifth birthday, because my father had remarried by that point, and we were having a party and had invited the other kids in my preschool class and their parents. I was running around with the other kids playing some game or other and tripped and either tore the dress I was wearing, or just got it dirty. Either way, my dad got extremely pissed off about it, took me into the house, and blistered my ass. He added another swat for every time I cried or screamed. I could barely walk by the time he was finished with me, and I remember being sore for quite a while afterward. As additional punishment, I wasn't allowed to wear nice clothes at home after that for a long time. Whenever I got home from preschool or we came home from church, I was told to immediately change out of the clothes I had been wearing and to put on one of my father's old T-shirts. I was given two, both with stains and holes in them. Those and my socks and underwear were the only clothes I was allowed to wear at home for what seems like months. I seem to recall that I wasn't allowed to put them in the laundry either, but I might be misremembering that part.

My oldest brother, who is eight years older than me, would terrorize and harrass me constantly, and my other brother, who is six years older, would help him, but the oldest was definitely the one who initiated almost everything. My dad and stepmom would have them ""wake me up"" if I didn't get up the first time the alarm clock went off, and I remember them doing stuff like dumping ice water on me and dragging my by the ankles out into and around the backyard as fast as they could run for a couple laps. I remember them laughing the whole time they did it. I didn't try to sleep in often. As my oldest brother started entering his teenage years he'd start terrorizing me with dead animals, mostly cats. I never saw him do it, but I suspect he was killing them himself. I have a rather vivid memory of him throwing a severed cat head at me one weekend when my dad and stepmom were away for some reason that I don't remember.

I was allowed to watch television, but only what my father wanted to watch (if he was home.) Otherwise the TV was supposed to be off. I didn't spend much time watching TV.

Being sick was no excuse for missing school. My dad was pissed the first time he had to leave the office and come pick me up, and after the first time he stopped answering calls from the school altogether. Whenever I was too sick to go to school, I would be literally locked in my room the entire day except for two five-minute periods, one in the morning and one in the evening, where I was allowed to use the bathroom. The rest of the time I had to either be asleep, doing schoolwork, reading the Bible, or just laying in bed not making any noise. The only food I was given when I was sick was a can of soup- literally the can and a can opener, no heating it up, no bowl, no spoon- and a slice or two of bread per day. They kept my door locked from the outside during these episodes. This was also a pretty standard punishment for whatever minor infraction might occur, like coughing or something during a moment of silence at church.

When I got to middle school (about age 12-13 for non-US readers) and we started getting homework, I started making money doing other kids' homework for them when I could. I kept this secret and I hid the money in my schoolbooks, because while I doubt my father and stepmother would have objected either to me making money or how I made it, I'm sure they would have confiscated it. I wasn't allowed to see friends outside of school unless it was for a school project, and even then only rarely. My father didn't want me getting in trouble or ""getting ideas"" or ""getting up to any stupid shit.""

It was also around 12 or 13 that the sexual abuse started, from both my brothers and my father. My father started ""supervising"" my showers. At first this was just him standing outside the bathroom door timing how long I was taking, I guess because he didn't want me masturbating or something, but pretty quickly it progressed to him being in the bathroom with me while I was in the shower. He'd sit on the toilet and he'd keep yelling at me to hurry up because I was wasting the hot water. After I think a couple weeks of that, he started actually joining me in the shower. Then afterward he'd punish me for ""putting impure thoughts in (his) head."" He'd call me a bitch and a whore and a temptress and demon-possessed and a lot of other things I don't recall right offhand as he either slapped me or lashed me with a belt. Always across the body and on the backside, of course. Nowhere that bruises would show, if he hit me hard enough to leave them, which was thankfully rare. He always had an erection in the shower and as he was ""punishing"" me afterward. This went on until the day I left.

My brothers, at first, tried to be more subtle about it, by sneaking into my room at night and trying to pull back the covers and lift up my shirt to feel my breasts without waking me up, and they might have succeeded at that a couple times, but most times I was awake for it, though I pretended to be asleep. I was afraid of what they'd do if they found out I was awake or tried to resist. usually it was both of them but sometimes it was just my oldest brother. It wasn't very long before they started masturbating while doing it, and it seems like it wasn't very long after that that they started ""waking me up"" and forcing me into sexual acts. At first it was just handjobs, but pretty soon they started forcing me to give them oral sex. They never tried to penetrate me though, I'm not sure why. If I had to guess I'd say that it's because they didn't want to risk me getting pregnant, but I never asked. This only went on for a couple years.

My father got me a job working in an office (I'm not sure what exactly they did there) with somebody he knew when I was 14. I did stuff like filing, getting coffee, janitorial work, anything an unskilled 14 year old could handle. I was paid in cash at the end of every day- five dollars a day, for what was usually two to three hours of work. Of course I was required to turn the money over to my father as soon as I got home, lest I spend it on something ""sinful."" I don't know what he did with it. Spent it on cigarettes is my guess.

Anyway... this kind of thing went on for years. My father came home pissed off about something one night when I was 18, and he kind of threw his car keys and a credit card at me and told me to go fill up his car's gas tank. Why he didn't do it himself on the way home I don't know, but regardless, I took his car to the gas station a couple blocks away and filled it up. Then I got back into the car and started up the engine, and I started thinking for a few minutes. I had a car and a credit card... and even though neither of them were mine, I could still go a damn long way with them. I could get away from my father and his abuse. I could go to a new city and start over, where nobody would know me, or him, or my family, and I could get a job that actually paid me minimum wage (or even more) and it wouldn't be stolen by my father the second I got home.

Then I drove back home.

I wanted to leave, I really did, but I was terrified of it. I didn't have any friends, and the only money I had was the stuff that I'd saved up from doing other kids' homework (which I was still doing at the time.) It took me another two years to work up the courage and desperation I needed to finally leave. I snuck into his bedroom pretty late one night, stole his credit card and keys, drove up to the local Walmart, and used his card to buy a pack of gum and get as much cash back as I could. I was terrified the whole time, afraid God would strike me down for stealing or the police would roll up with their lights flashing and sirens blaring or something.

Anyway... once I had the cash, which wasn't much, I drove down to the local bus station and bought a ticket going to the furthest city they went to. Once we arrived I did it again. I left the car parked on the street a couple blocks away, and bent the credit card in half until it broke and threw away one of the pieces immediately. Somewhere in between cities I threw the car keys out the bus window and into the ditch at the side of the road. I stuffed the other half of the credit card into the trash at a convenience store near the bus station once we arrived.

I didn't really know where I was going. I wanted to get to the other side of the world, but I didn't have nearly enough money to do that, and even if I had I didn't have a passport, so I settled for another couple bus rides, winding up about halfway across the continental US from where I started, and... then I realized I had no idea what I was going to do.

"Wow.. I just realized that this kind of applies to me.

When I was younger, with my mother things were kind of rough.  Pretty abusive actually.

Well, one time when i was 15 things got really bad.  it started when her siste rmoved in.  she treated us like slaves, we were expected to cook and clean for her and just generally be at her beck and call.  

well, this one particular night I was expected to cook chicken for her and her boyfriend, then clean it up and basically be her little kitchen slave so she could be the fancy lady.

This, pissed me off to no end.  I was expected to not only cook a meal i wasn't allowed to eat.  Then I had to clean up and do the dishes for that meal for some guy i've never met so she can get laid?  wtf   I refused.  It turned into a big fight.  

So, When my mother came home she got mad at me.

She beat me, but that wasn't even the worst part.  that I was used to.  She slapped me across the face with a slipper.   that was by far the least physically abusive thing she had done, but for some reason it ws new and it pushed me over the edge.  i silently took it and went to bed.

The next morning I poured out my book bag.   I packed a few things that meant something to me.

It still boggles my mind.   just picking whats important into a bag in the span of 15 minutes.  It changes the way you think about things if you ever have to do that...


anyway, I packed a few things, and went to school.  As soon as I got there i found a quarter, god knows where and called a cab.  Its funny now because i had to get the operator to dial because i was upset and couldnt figure out how to do it.

I went to my grandmothers in the next town over.   I didnt' have five cents to my name, she might not have even been home.  but I went.   when i got there i told her i took a cab and i wasn't going back.


She of course called my mom.  who told my grandmother and I quote.

""Tell him he no longer has a mother.""

So, i lived with my grandmother, switched schools, and no one ever hit me again.  (well,  until my drunk dad moved in, but thats another story)

she was my hero.   she was always there for me.  I used to look at the lights from my bedroom window and wish i was there with her.


She died april 21 of this ear.   its... hard.   my entire life from the point of 15 to 37 was devoted to her.  now she's gone.    I still at night look at the lights, but this time they're the stars n the sky, and i wish i was with her.",2015-05-28 23:29:38,jax9999,20

I told my roomate when they called a few days later (I was in school housing, so I didn't dick them over), and a friend from work the day I left when she called wanting to get some dinner.

"Obesity and overeating in general. Two fucking thirds of the U.S. population fall under  the category of obese or overweight. It's gotten to the point where you can't fucking go outside anymore without seeing at least 2 of these hamplanets porking around on their scootypuffs at any one time. It's gotten so bad that it's made us the laughing stock of the world. 

And now with this ridiculous HAES shit. And it's not even health at every size, it's just the land whales saying ""health at my size"", AKA HAMS. Part of the problem is that everyone blames it on their genetic condishuns, when most likely 80% or more of these walking (barely) garbage disposals have no genetic conditions that contribute to weight gain, it's just that they are bunch of lazy pigs. And for those that do have genetic conditions, they're not going to make you balloon up to 400lbs, at most they only contribute to less than 20lbs of weight gain. Weight gain that can still be controlled.

If that's not bad enough, these butter-huffers are putting a larger strain on our medical system than on the reinforced chairs they have to sit on. They are costing the healthcare system, and by extension the taxpayers, billions of dollars yearly.

"A car I bought and a necklace I gave a girl.. 

Bit of a story behind this one.. I think when we started dating I was 16 and she was 14, so you still very new to the world of 'love' and relationships. She lived an hour away from me, and was literally the reason I got my license ASAP and saved up a car. Every cent I earned pretty much went into keeping this 15 year old shit fighter alive / full of fuel so I could see her.

One day, she made an off hand comment about how it sucked that I never actually bought her anything.. Which kinda hurt, but I thought fuck it, she is right. So I saved up. I searched. In the end, I settled on what I could only describe as the perfect opal, had all the right colours, was very pleasing on the eye, set into a little gold  pendant on a very fine, gold chain.

When I gave it to her, she literally cried. It was the first gift she'd ever received from anybody. She wore it everywhere. She never took it off. I can't even begin to describe what it used to do to my nearly 17 year old self to see her wearing that, and only that. She was just beautiful.

After I turned 17, I had to move to the other end of the country for a year for study, and being the tender ages of 17 and 15, we believed we could make long distance work, cause you know, them dreams of marriage, right?

Well.. The inevitable happened. We fought the entire year. We made up for the entire year. We broke up. We got back together. I finished my study, and I drove home. I drove that same shitfighter back to our side of the country 4,000km away. She didn't know I was coming back home at this stage.. And when I walked into her work to surprise the now 16 year old girl who I had fallen into that puppy love with, you can't even describe how I felt when I saw her wearing that necklace.

Then came what was mostly 6 months of bliss.. I got a new car, but kept the old shitfighter. She was doing great in school, things seemed great.

But it was shortlasted.. She grew distant.. And then stopped talking to me altogether.. Everytime I visited her, she wouldn't look at me, she wouldn't speak, she wouldn't say a word.. This went on for a month.. In the end, on a Monday, I went over I told her I couldn't do it anymore, couldn't keep talking to myself, and said I was going to give her some space until she sorted her headspace out. On the Friday.. She was dating one of the Army blokes that get stationed here where I live from interstate..

A week later, I received a letter in the mail, with two words - ""I'm Sorry"" and the necklace..

The next few months were hell. The torment of wondering how long it had gone on for drove me insane. At 18, I believed this girl was going to be my life. I gave her everything I could. I was there for her through the depression, through the self harm, through everything.. And I lost it all to some tosser in a uniform and nice car.. I actually went mad trying to reason it all out.

So one night.. I got in that old shitfighter, wearing that necklace, and I lined up the powerpole at the end of the road 3km away.. And then I began accelerating. I hit 190km/h by the time I left the road. But then I missed the power pole, and rolled the car 4 times, and somehow walked away from the wreck.. One week later, I destroyed the necklace. Broke every linkage. Turned the rock to dust.. And put it in an envelope and gave it straight back to her.

They say your soulmate isn't the person you have the most in common with, but the person who feels like home. I felt like our relationship was home. No amount of other relationships of any depth or commitment with completely different girls were the same.

But.. I grew up, and just like real life, when you grow up, you move out of home. My future doesn't lie at what feels like home.

Nicole, I hope you're doing okay. I hope he makes you happy.

TLDR - Wrecked a car and a necklace, both of which I bought because of puppy love for a girl.",2015-05-29 07:53:40,rustlethemjimmies,1

"Around the time the Xbox 360 came out I'm sure a lot of you remember the dreaded ""red ring of death"".

Well I was playing a game (can't remember which one) when I got the red ring of death and as you can imagine, I was platinum mad. Still, I kept my composure and managed to get it swapped for a new one at the local game store. 

A couple of weeks later I was playing Oblivion when all of a sudden, boom, red rings on the NEW console. I was really mad so I grabbed it and shook it while shouting ""YOU PIECE OF SHIT""

Terrible idea. 

Shaking the console while it was turned on made the laser burn up the disk and completely fuck it. That was it, that was the final straw...

I basically ripped the console out of my TV stand and ran downstairs. I then proceeded to open the door to the garden and I threw it as far as I could causing it to bounce off one of the stepping stones in the garden. But it wasn't over... I then ran up up to the pond and grabbed a giant rock that was placed next to it for decoration, from there I smashed the console about 15 times until most of my rage was gone.

After that I just sat there, looking at the pieces scattered everywhere with a big shit-eating grin on my face. I then had to buy another one for like £300 which was a lot for me at the time but it was worth it, it needed to be done. It must have served as a spiritual warning to the next one because I never had a problem with it and it's still running perfectly to this day.",2015-05-29 08:07:07,J_R_Taylor,1

It was one of the big tests that was requried to pass the course. 

And I watched the deadline pass by...And I threw that fucking laptop at the wall so hard it went to pieces. And yes, I failed the course.

The Chinese hardly learn about Rome and Greece either.
Indians and Persians learn about Alexander and his conquests but there hardly any mention of Rome or Greece before Alexander.
Middle Easterners learn mostly, if nothing else, Islamic history.

"FADE IN

INT. A BANK LOBBY - DAY

*We see an upscale bank lobby populated by a handful of patrons, all of whom are going about their own business. At first, nothing seems amiss... until two masked BANDITS - each clad in black-and-white-striped shirts - burst through the front doors and fire submachine guns in the air.*

**BANDIT ONE:** This is a robbery! Nobody move!    
**BANDIT TWO:** Everybody put your hands in the air!    
**BANDIT ONE:** Yeah, do that, but then *don't move!*

*All of the patrons freeze in place, their arms held above their heads.*

**BANDIT ONE:** Okay, where's the manager? *Where is the bank manager?!*

*The second BANDIT leaps over the counter and rushes up to an overweight man in a suit. This is the MANAGER.*

**BANDIT TWO:** You! You're the manager!    
**MANAGER:** No, I'm not.

*The first BANDIT joins his partner behind the counter. He approaches the MANAGER, whom he smacks across the face.*

**BANDIT ONE:** You're the manager!    
**MANAGER:** Jeez, fine, I'm the manager.   
**BANDIT TWO:** Give us all of the money, and don't try anything stupid!    
**MANAGER:** Okay, but I have to open the vault first.    
**BANDIT ONE:** ... What?    
**BANDIT TWO:** The big safe. That's where the money is. It's called a vault.    
**BANDIT ONE:** Oh, yeah, I knew that.

*A sudden commotion draws everyone's attention back to the front door. Three uniformed POLICE OFFICERS rush into the bank, their weapons drawn.*

**OFFICER ONE:** Drop your guns! This robbery is over!    
**BANDIT ONE:** Nuh-uh! We have the manager, and we're kidnapping him!    
**MANAGER:** No, you're not. You're holding me hostage.    
**OFFICER TWO:** What's the difference?    
**MANAGER:** You have to take the person somewhere for it to be kidnapping.    
**BANDIT ONE:** Okay, we're holding his hopscotch!    
**OFFICER THREE:** Not if you're *dead!*

*The third OFFICER opens fire. His cohorts immediately follow suit.*

**BANDIT TWO:** Stop, stop, *stop!*

*All of the shooting ceases.*

**OFFICER ONE:** What now?    
**BANDIT TWO:** Police can't shoot first! *Bad guys* shoot first! That's the rule!    
**MANAGER:** That's not true!    
**BANDIT TWO:** Yes *huh!* Police can't shoot until the bad guys do!    
**BANDIT ONE:** Well, just pretend *we* shot first, then?    
**BANDIT TWO:** Okay.

*Bullets immediately begin flying through the bank again. Several shots strike the first BANDIT in the chest, but he continues to act as though nothing happened.*

**OFFICER THREE:** I shot you, Kevin! You're dead!    
**BANDIT ONE:** Nuh-uh!    
**OFFICER THREE:** Yes *huh!* I totally shot you! Lie down!    
**BANDIT ONE:** Nuh-uh, you didn't, because I have a force field!

*A shimmering, translucent sphere engulfs the first BANDIT.*

**OFFICER ONE:** No fair! No force fields!    
**OFFICER TWO:** I have grenades that break force fields!

*The second OFFICER pulls a grenade from his belt and lobs it towards the BANDITS.*

**BANDIT ONE:** Okay, but then I catch it and I throw it back at you!

*The OFFICERS look down to see the grenade at their feet.*

**OFFICER THREE:** No, um... because... because police can't be hurt by grenades!    
**BANDIT TWO:** They can too!    
**MANAGER:** Yeah, they can.    
**BANDIT TWO:** Shut up, Tommy.    
**MANAGER:** I'm not playing anymore! I'm a racecar driver now!

*The MANAGER quickly exits the bank, hops into a waiting Formula One car, and speeds off.*

**OFFICER ONE:** Nice one, *Alan*.    
**BANDIT TWO:** Shut up. It's not my fault.    
**OFFICER TWO:** Kevin, you're still dead. Lie down.    
**BANDIT ONE:** I'm not playing anymore, either.    
**BANDIT TWO:** Hey, no fair! You can't have three police against one bad guy!    
**OFFICER THREE:** Okay, um... okay, pretend I was a bad guy in disguise the whole time!

*The third OFFICER rips off his uniform, revealing a black-and-white-striped shirt.*

**OFFICER TWO:** What? No *traitors!* You can't do that!    
**BANDIT TWO:** I don't want to be the only bad guy!

*The rumble of a racecar engine becomes audible again. The MANAGER reenters the bank, a look of delight on his face.*

**MANAGER:** Guys, guys! I just had an awesome idea!    
**OFFICER ONE:** What is it?    
**MANAGER:** What if we were on a *spaceship?*

*A moment of silence passes.*

**BANDIT ONE:** I have a lightsaber!    
**OFFICER THREE:** Me too! Oh, oh, and I have a laser gun!    
**BANDIT TWO:** I get to be an alien!

*The BANDITS, OFFICERS, and MANAGER all rush from the bank. The patrons are left standing there, all of their arms still held aloft.*

**PATRON:** What the *fuck* just happened?

Who asked for an additional £270 odd million and help from the army to police the London Olympics (on top of their £280 million+ initial fee).  Who were shown to have cheated on security tests for guarding US nuclear sites.  Who ""accidentally"" killed a deported refugee in front of an entire aircraft full of passengers, whilst trying to put him on a flight.  Who were caught defrauding the UK government on their electronic tagging contract by charging for dead people and people back in prison.

This is a company that seems to systematically under-bid for contracts and ask for more money, and who fuck up every single thing they are associated with.  Yet they still get awarded multi-million pound contracts.  Whoever owns this company must have video of the entire Tory party running a train on a 14 year old male prostitute.",2015-05-28 12:41:01,Meihem76,524

Their big thing was taking three unrelated anime series (Super Dimension Fortress Macross,  Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross and Genesis Climber MOSPEADA), and adapting and dubing (and arguably trying to ""americanize"" it too) them into one syndicated series, Robotech.

They've since done a few other minor series, even attempted a dub of Dragonball (renamed Goku to Zero among other atrocities), and these days are a real estate company. 

And a lot of people want HG to just die so they can release their deathgrip on anything resembling Macross, they even stopped some [GI Joe set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_Gold_USA#Legal_issues) from coming out awhile back, and DMCA'ed a mexican(?)

Someone was paying attention to me and *cared* about me, even just a teeny bit - swoon. He also looked me in the eyes when he talked to me, which I find most people don't do for some reason. Aw, I miss that guy. :)",2015-05-28 13:01:50,saucity,402

"Cover me! 😍


I ate lunch way too fast on the way to my friend's house yesterday. I was so full I was legit sleepy, which is weird cause I'm never a daytime sleeper. Regardless I balled up as comfy as I could on my part of the couch and dozed. After a few minutes of video games, I hear him get up and next thing, there's a blanket on me. I reflexively snuggled it and mumbled thanks, then continued half-sleeping. When I woke back up I melted at how cozy I was thanks to the soft blanket. 


Another time I was in class, I'd dressed for hot weather that never came, and was sitting in a room with the ac blasting chilly air. As much as I love cold weather, I was unprepared and admittedly suffering. 


A very cute classmate who always sat with me offered me a jacket. At first I scoffed, ""Are you making fun of me?"" ... we had one of those friendships of kidding around, so I really thought he was... Especially since he was wearing a tank top and no jacket in sight. I tried to take some notes down but to my embarrassment, I'm shivering. 


Classmate opens his backpack and pulls out a glorious plush hoodie, and hands it to me. I actually swoon. Wore it backwards like a snuggie and could smell subtle male fragrance/soap from the hood. Oh my god this was like a year ago and I still get butterflies. If I were single I'd've asked him out that day, lol.",2015-05-28 15:28:58,DCsThrowaway,31

Edit: Before one more idiot replies by saying ""So playing with a baby is sexual?"", go back to school.

""Also non-sexual"" means that the first item was also not sexual.",2015-05-28 09:26:13,Reddosaur,267
