"I believe it's posture related. Standing up correctly involves permanent use of some ab muscles. If you've spent a long time slouched these muscles weaken, so when you stand, your hips/upper back may over compensate. Try googling how to stand tall, or correct standing postures. Also trimming down a bit wouldn't hurt if you want them to really carve out.",2015-05-29 00:27:10,rukarioz,118
"Former physical therapy aide here. You can do something we call a ""pelvic tilt"" to help this. If you know much about anatomy, your hips can tilt, usually either posteriorly (back) or anteriorly (front). Tilting your hips posteriorly will help. To best understand what I mean, lay flat on a stiff surface, like the floor, and bend your knees so that your feet are on the floor, shoulder width, and legs are roughly 90 degrees. At this point, you can slide your hand under your lower back. Tighten your core and tilt your hips like you're pulling them up to your ribs, which will press your lower back into your hand. This is a posterior tilt. If you do this while standing, you will have better posture and will see the ""resting gut"" decrease, but it may not disappear completely.

The rest of it is probably just some body fat.",2015-05-29 03:31:02,JangaJam,14
"Whenever you grow abdominal muscle, your stomach gets larger. Even If you have large abs and extremely low body fat when you are relaxed your stomach is going to have ""resting gut"" even more so than a person with small abs at a similar body fat percentage.

Your abdominal cavity is full of your internal organs and intestines that exert pressure on your abdominal area due to gravity and push your stomach out when their isn't resistance. That's why you may notice you have worse ""resting gut"" whenever you have just had a big meal.

Don't worry about it man! It's completely normal.

There are 2 ways you can make having this better. I've trained myself to always hold my stomach in a little bit, the same way you  teach yourself to hold your back straight for good posture. Eventually it becomes automatic.

The other option is to do vacuums, this trains the transverse abdominis. The stronger this muscle is the tighter your gut will be held in at a resting state, and the harder your will be able to suck in your stomach.",2015-05-29 01:19:17,aaronis1,46
"Everyone is saying core, vacuum, posture. I think all this will help but I think the real issue is your body fat. You're at a normal healthy % prolly lower teens or so. You want them abs to show up while resting you'll have to drop below 10%. The depth of your belly button indicates that you still have a thin layer of fat wrapped around your waist like a corset. 

Drop about 10 more pounds and report back. And do this slowly; an aggressive diet at your size will likely cost you muscle and your abs will stay hidden.",2015-05-29 03:45:50,edelboy,33
"Lots of good ideas here. 

Work your intercostal abs with stomach vacuums and planks. They keep your core tight and tucked. 

Correct postural imbalances by strengthening lower back and abs and stretching hip flexors. Tilt your pelvis forward/up and then relax your glutes so that your core is holding the position. Practice this! 

Strengthen core using standing exercises to help your mind and brain engage the core while standing upright. 

Pelvic floor exercises are good too, do some kegals. Think of the muscle to stop the flow of urinating, but don't practice while actually urinating because it can be unhealthy.",2015-05-29 01:42:37,NotSureIfFunnyOrSad,16

"An issue that I haven't seen mentioned here is visceral fat vs. subcutaneous fat. People tend to think of fat as all being right under your skin, padding the outside of your body, but there is also fat which accumulates around your internal organs or ""viscera.""

I seem to have trouble with this because I appear skinny and have very little fat between my skin and abdominal muscles, but I still have a ""gut"" that sticks out when I relax. I think that part of my problem is APT which has been mentioned a lot in this thread, but I still have a rounded gut that sticks out when I relax and no amount of posture change is going to make it completely flat. 

Aside from looking bad, high visceral abdominal fat is also concerning because it's correlated with increased risk for heart disease. From what I can tell there's no specific way to fight it, only fat reduction through exercising more and reducing caloric intake. I also read one article finding that high abdominal fat is associated with binge drinking (consuming a large number of drinks in a short amount of time.)

"A lot of people are trying to give fancy fixes for this but...

Honestly, to an extent this is extremely normal. Your abdominal wall takes up space, and as your abs get bigger, they're going to push out further unless you're actively contracting them.

Combine this with the fact that, unless you're constantly starving yourself, you will normally have a food bolus in your stomach contributing to the effect, this is not abnormal. 

I think our expectations are distorted from pictures of people flexing their abs to perfection for photoshoots and celebrities that suck in their guts all the time.

"IIRC it has a couple of key components to it. I, a long time beer-gut sufferer, had a similar issue. Core strength, both front abs, and lower back, help to pull in your gut while resting, but along with that comes posture, because no amount of muscle, can make you have good posture. Dieting does considerably help, since the fat that is causing the issue, is the outer fat, which can be burned off, and avoided by eating more fruits and veggies. I recommend having a fresh smoothie to start your day.

For a while now, I've been changing the way I eat, and I've lost over 70 pounds since the beginning just from diet change alone.  I now have been looking for a bodyweight program that maybe you can suggest for someone who hasn't done much exercise in over 10 years.

I look for a lot of sets but I was hoping to have someone that really knows what they're doing (and live here, of course) to maybe put me in the right direction--starting-wise.

Nutritionists are people with no specific training who you pay a bunch of money to in exchange for a mediocre plan you'll probably follow because you paid a bunch of money for it.

"Qualified Nutritionist from the UK here (Registered with the AFN, currently work with high performance sports and start a sports nutrition post graduate research position in September).

The Title of this post is correct, the term Nutritionist in NOT legally protected (in the UK at least). However, I don't think we should tar everyone with the same brush.

I'm a member of the Association for Nutrition, a voluntary register which is attempting to legally protect the term nutritionist. You can only become a member of the AFN if you have at least a BSc in a recognised degree (Human Nutrition, Dietetics, Nutrition and Health etc.). For anyone who isn't from the UK, we study the same subject for 4 years at University, we do not major and minor etc.

Making Nutritionist a legally protected title is something I'm REALLY passionate about. I studied for 4 years, covering subjects such as advanced physiology, nutritional biochemistry, food chemistry, food microbiology, sports nutrition and clinical dietetics. At the end of my degree I decided to go into sports nutrition, rather than do my post graduate diploma which would make me a Dietitian.

I have a four year, evidence based degree with a great understanding of various sciences that come together to make 'nutrition science'. It infuriates me that someone can do a 6 week course (or just read a book at home) and call themselves a nutritionist. Most of the time these practitioners are not evidence based and are preaching pretty dangerous stuff (think the Food Babe).

Clinical settings are NOT the only place where bad nutrition advice can be dangerous/lethal. A UK woman (about 10 years ago? Cannot verify) was told by a nutritional therapist to reduce her salt intake (to almost zero) and drink a shit load of water. On top of that she was exercising on a regular basis to lose weight - she ended up in a hyponatremic coma and died. A Nutritionist from the AFN, with a recognised degree would NEVER make such a recommendation. 

I am begging people to please not tar people with the same brush, Dara O'Brien is a prick for making that statement, even in a comedic setting.

This brings me on to my next point. Nutritionists, Dietitians, Physiologists etc. can be up-to-date, evidence based practitioners or they can be lazy quacks pushing out-of-date guidelines which have been based on terrible scientific research.

Being a dietitian or nutritionist doesn't actually mean anything in terms of your practice, it just means you were able to jump through some hoops (AKA pass the exam).

It is very rare that you will find a dietitian 'high up' in the field of sports nutrition, typically the leaders in that field are exercise physiologists, who have a much greater understanding of physiology and nutrition in that context. There are RD's however, who learn all the exercis physiology AFTER their clinical training and do quite well.

To be honest the world of Nutrition is a fucking mess. The government, dietitians, nutritionists, doctors and physiologists have all got a lot to learn. Please bear with us and we'll try and fix things. We are sorry for all the confusion in the field!",2015-05-29 04:00:11,podgey88,3

As a kid it took me a while - I liked soccer and basketball, hated baseball (my eye-hand coordination was terrible), but really found my niche in track/cross country.  I also came to realize the only reason I seemed good at soccer was that I was faster than most of the kids on the field, my ball control was still fairly shitty, but I could outsprint a defender and cross the ball so the guy who was actually accurate could take the shot.

Encourage them to play outside when they're younger - tag, manhunt, riding bikes, catch, the works.  That builds up the coordination, etc that they'll need when they actually start in sports.

"Hi!

I remember, when I used to frequent Sherdog Strength and Power forums, there was a really strong and jacked dude who had Crohn's. His training was just simple powerlifting based training. His log was my favorite log to read on that site. He was always in and out of the hospital while taking a bunch of different antibiotics. I don't think that guy ever had a day, where he felt good. **BUT, he almost never missed a workout**, and always training his heart out. He always had encouraging things to say, and never let his Crohn's disease get him down mentally. Unfortunately, I can't remember his username, and I think that forum got changed to Strength and Conditioning or something, but I will always remember that training log. 

Anyway, my point is that regardless of Crohn's you definetely can get strong and fit. Train hard, utilize a simple strength program such as starting strength or Bill Starr 5v5, and *just eat what you can.* Don't worry about macro's, proteins, carbs, whatever. Simply just try to eat whatever you can. 

As for where to start: Start by doing what you can. The easiest change is to remove obvious crap from your diet, like soda's, McDonals, ect. You mentioned that you currently don't have access to a gym membership. You can start by walking. Then, start jogging. Find some stairs you can sprint up. Do pushups, sit-ups, and work up to pullups (i guarentee there's some king of bar somewhere you can do pullups on). You can 100% build a good basis of strength from bodyweight and barbell-less exercises. Get some old tires and flip them or carry them. Ross Enamait's Never Gymless is a good book for some cool bodyweight stuff. You can do a bunch of interval style training with bodyweight.

Save your money for a gym membership. I don't know where you are from, but Planet Fitness (yes, I know is a shit gym, but machines and light dumbells are better than nothing) is only 10 dollars a month. Maybe find a local YMCA, or even your high school gym. One of the best gym's I've ever lifted in was my local, dinky YMCA. They had these old fantastic nautilus machines, those nice loud 45's, and those old badass round dumbells. Was a really cool place to lift. 

As for motivation: At the end of the day, you need to really WANT change. Envision yourself one day strong, muscular, whatever your goal is and burn that image into your mind. Every day, when you wake up, just think to yourself ""by tonight, I'm going to be stronger than I am now."" 

I hope this post helps you, and maybe gives you some motivation. If you work hard, stay consistent, you can 100% reach your fitness goals.",2015-05-29 02:42:16,kinganthony3,21
"Hey man. 
Really admirable that you're looking to make a start on getting fit.

I also have Crohn's disease so I could probably pitch in here. 

Get on a strength routine (stronglifts 5x5 worked for me) and work on increasing your food intake little by little as much as you can tolerate.

Liquid calories really helped me out here when Im ill. Complan/ensure and protein shakes forever. Calories are calories!

You will have off days, we all do but a long term progression of fitness is a marathon, not a sprint so one session here or there where you're glued to the toilet (know these feels) wont make too much difference.

Best of luck and feel free to shoot me any questions if you have them.",2015-05-29 04:23:22,RobMonty93,7

"for cardio vascular health and endurance, I'd say start with walking. Long 20-30 minute walks above your normal walking pace. Maybe about 50% faster than your standard stride. Even today, I'm very fit and my favorite cardio exercise is on a treadmill with it on full incline and 2.5 MPH (15-45 minute cardio sessions)

I know almost nothing about your disease, just the very basics. I don't know what your limitations are. But getting protein in your diet will be essential for gaining a bit of muscle.

Start out with light weights, no need to impress anyone or anything like that. 

Because you don't have a gym membership, going to the park and doing pushups, pull ups (which are very hard), jumps, lunges, standing squats. 

here is a great video of exercises you can do at the park!

"I was in pretty much the same situation. A couple months ago when I started my first semester of college I ate like shit for a month and gained 15 pounds.

This just sounds like you used to count calories and now that you've done that you know what you're doing and how much calories are in things by eyeballing etc. Thing is lots of people who have never tracked calories before will make terrible estimates.,2015-05-29 04:32:41,oramidriven,1
"I have lost 40 pounds in the last year. I could not for the life of me tell you how many calories I'm eating, or what my macros are. I reduced my portion sizes within an already healthy diet, and I lost weight.

"I started counting last summer and successfully dropped about 19kg. I'm sitting comfortably about 94kg without counting and I'm still getting stronger and leaner.

"I am totally on board with the science or whatever of counting calories but it just doesn't work for me. Sorry I should rephrase - I don't care enough to make it work for me. I am firmly on the 'lots of veggies' diet - I figure if 60% of my diet is veggies, imma struggle to eat over my TDEE very often. By doing this i've dropped 15kg. Could it have been faster if I had tracked calories? Yes, definitely. Would I have enjoyed my life as much? I don't think so. I once read a comment on this subreddit where the guy said when he went out to the pub, he would input his alcohol intake whilst at the bar ordering another drink. To me personally this just sounded incredibly said (even if it is the best way to do it for weight loss). **My advice** stop tracking if you its taking too much time or whatever and just be sensible with what you eat **but** bare in mind that your weight loss may be slower.",2015-05-29 05:46:51,Braveheart1297,1
"That's roughly what I do for bulking. I keep track of my calories and macros for a while until this particular meal plan becomes a habit. From there on, I just stop measuring but keep reading the same things. I don't mind having fluctuations of 100 or even 200kcal while bulking.

When cutting on the other hand, I count everything, mostly because I'm afraid of getting too little and losing weight too quickly.",2015-05-29 05:51:19,tsahyt,1
"I gave up on counting calories a long time ago and can still bulk or cut successfully, if not quite optimally. Cutting at 2250 in and 2500 out is easy to measure, but I work a very physical job in addition to lifting and other exercise. When you're trying to cut at 7750/8000, 250 calories is well below the margin of error in your food and exercise measurements. I eat clean when I cut and sort of clean when I bulk and let my body tell me how much to eat and it works.

"I used to count calories, but was to much hassle fr me. Especially when you're on business lunch or visiting family. I am focusing on correct type of foods I put in my mouth (meat and veggies). Cut any sugary drinks and sweets, limited coffee to black, etc. I lost ~45 pounds of fat getting some lean mass. That strategy is just not working when you want to go below 13% of bf I stalled for few months. Then I introduced Intermittent fasting and things started to move again.

"I'm on a cut and I don't count my calories strictly. I know aproximately how many calories I eat on each meal (for example, if for breakfast I have a banana, a cup of coffee and a cereal bar, I know that I'm going to be eating around 200-250 calories), and that's it for me.

"I (44 y/o F) had a 30 lb weight loss quite a few years back and have managed to maintain my weight within about a 3-7 lb variation without counting all the time. Here's what I do:

* during periods of calorie counting I pay attention to my habits and work on developing eating patterns and go-to foods that keep me at a desired intake. For example:  knowing &amp; using correct portion sizes, pouring a snack food into a serving bowl rather than eating from the box/bag, drinking plenty of water, etc.

* I weigh regularly (at least 2-3 times/week so that I will notice if I start to gain weight

* If/when I notice I have put on some extra pounds that aren't attributable to fluctuations in hydration, I calorie count for at least a week (or more if I really need to drop pounds) so I can see what's up with my diet. Usually it's extra alcohol consumption and creeping snack habits, plus winter periods of less sports activity, getting me in a excess calorie state.

This has worked really well for me but I am not *too* stringent about my weight/body composition. In other words, I lift but I don't bulk and cut, so I have a nice muscular trim physique but it's not like you can cut things on my abs.",2015-05-29 07:40:35,b00tler,1
"I stopped counting calories for the past 3 months or so. After a while of doing it you become aware of approximately how many calories / macros something has and it's not hard keeping mental track of it throughout the day. However, I do find it harder to actually stick to dieting without tracking. Even if you are aware of how many you are consuming, my mind is like whatever i don't care, i'll have this snack even if i'm over my limit. 

During this period I wasn't really focusing on dieting, I ended up severely under eating on some days (approx. 800 calories) and over eating other days (approx. 2500+ calories).
My progress was way slower than it had been the prior months.

I've started calorie counting again the past few weeks and I find it so much easier to stay on a healthy path and reduce cravings. If you are over stressing about it i recommend to take a break for a couple of days/weeks and then when you come back to it it will be much less stressful. At least that is what my experience has been like.",2015-05-29 07:53:56,besosjinx,1
"I tracked my calories for a good 6-7 months and got really comfortable knowing how many calories a certain amount of food was. However, my schedule got busy and I haven't been tracking. I prep meals and always calculate the portion size and its calorie amount, but I think I'm struggling because I'm not actually counting my calories throughout the day. I stick to my prepped meals but then I tend to come home later at night and just roam free through different snacks. So I think for me and a lot of other people it actually takes logging throughout the day to see success on a cut.",2015-05-29 08:08:10,mhm33,1
"Yes. I just avoid dairy and grains. I try to eat only from the edges of the grocery - produce, butcher, etc. That helps me gain lean muscle (more protein) and slim down a little.  Going to eat out on the weekends only helps. 

I also use my palms to measure. A serving fits in my palm. That. Is. All!

Counting calories seems like a terrible waste of time and energy. It seems obsessive, and it doesn't ensure that you are eating quality foods with enough nutrients. 

That said, imagine you had to pay $1 per calorie for a week, and that may help evaluate some foods. You *may* come to find that you want the most bang for your buck - better flavor, nutrition, and value.",2015-05-29 08:12:37,leftcoastisbestcoast,1
"If you are just looking to have a healthy, normal physique, then calorie counting shouldn't be necessary. It's when you go for the athletic, fit body that it becomes indispensable. Based on one of your comments, you should be around 25% BF [(145x0.3-10)/135]x100%. This is assuming no loss or increase in muscle mass so could be incorrect. 

At this percentage, you still have some low hanging fruit, and a healthy lifestyle should continue your weight loss. However, to get to your ideal weight of 125, you will be around 19% BF without change in muscle mass [(135x.25-10)/125]x100%, and at that level, maintenance without some form of calorie counting will be very difficult.

Keep in mind that at this level, you will see diminishing returns to your dieting, so you will have to increase your effort to get results.",2015-05-29 08:15:44,feduzzle,1

I track and I don't track...just really depends. I did it for over 3 years straight and honestly it just gets old since I know what I eat. Once you have a better understanding of your body and what you put in it the tracking part becomes somewhat less useful. I find the best thing to do is use tracking to get yourself back into the right mindset.

"Today is day 763 of my MyFitnessPal streak. I lost 15lbs over 4 months or so when I first downloaded the app and since then I've been fluctuating from ~163-~168.  
  What happens to me is that I will get down to 163, which is a great weight for me, but then I will stop stressing about putting everything in and slowly, fish and chips, alcohol, not counting tortilla chips, etc. catches up to me and I'm near 168 again. I've honestly never been able to eat at maintenance for very long, I'm constantly cycling between gaining and losing weight (which i guess is fine, consider my 5lb gain a mini bulk).  
What I suggest is you keep putting in breakfast and lunch so that you know how many calories you have for dinner, and then just eyeball dinner. Not measuring anything has never worked for me. But there are a couple hundred days out of my 763 streak where I add breakfast (coffee and a quest bar) and lunch but leave everything consumed after 2pm out of my diary.  
  Considering you're getting to your goal weight, if you start eyeballing things and gain a few pounds, you will know. My abs look way way different with just a 5lb difference in my bodyweight. Congrats on nearing the end of your cut!",2015-05-29 09:38:06,MinimumWage1,1

Counting calories wasn't something I felt I could maintain forever in my life. I'm still trying to lose weight and my GW is 165. Now if I start lifting and trying to gain muscle, counting macros and calories will probably be necessary. I'm sure I could lose weight faster by counting calories, but it's a personal choice not to. 

As for your personal situation, I think you could stop counting if you just want to maintain where you're at. But if you have really specific goals, you probably need very specific tools like calorie counting.",2015-05-29 09:41:33,brndnzlda,1

"I'm 5'11"" (M) 165 pounds at 9% BF, sitting at about 108 pounds of muscle, and I've never counted calories (other than 3 or 4 times where I just wanted to see how much I normally eat in a day). I just don't eat shit that comes in a box.  It's pretty simple.  Don't eat fast food, don't eat processed foods, and only eat lean meats.  Don't eat cereal that's half sugar, and get bread without added sugar (but don't eat more than 2 slices a day).  No chips, no chocolate/candy unless it's 80% or higher dark chocolate made from cocoa.  You need to stay away from sugars.  Even things like greek yogurt, which people swear is some miracle food, actually isn't good for you considering a serving has 15-20 grams of sugar. 

The things you should be eating are vegetables for sustenance, brown rice and sweet potato for carbohydrates.  Protein should come from fish like Cod or Sole, Turkey or lean chicken breasts.  Stay away from crap like soy and flax seed.  I'm assuming you are a woman, so you should look to avoid things that contain aromatase.  Healthy fats will come from the fish you eat (but not the cod) and you can add SMALL amounts of nuts like almonds or brazil nuts.  BAM that's all your macros without adding any significant amount of calories to your day. 

Drink water, never juice.  No pop, no gatorade or sports drinks.  WATER. 

I'm not a nutritionist or a dietitian or anything, but counting calories is absolutely retarded.  Use your common sense and eat healthy food.  A calorie **IS NOT** a calorie, as much as the marketing people want to make you believe.  Don't count your calories, just eat the right foods. 

As Michael Pollan wrote: ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.""

Good luck. 

EDIT: I should say, counting calories isn't retarded for someone with an eating disorder, say someone who is 400+ pounds.  They need to understand that they are eating way too freaking much, and counting calories might be the only way to show them.  But for a female under 150 pounds or a male under 200 pounds, they have absolutely NO REASON to be counting calories.  They just need to be mindful of the processed junk they are putting into their bodies.  I've tracked calories for a day or two, and I'm actually in the 3500-4000 per day range.  Take it as anecdotal or whatever you want, but I maintain a sub 10% BF and I always eat the same way.  (I eat a metric shit-ton of healthy foods everyday).
