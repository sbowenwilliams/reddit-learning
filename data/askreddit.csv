"Fine,

I have two principals, Be lazy, and do what I want.  I have yet to determine an order to these principals. 

So I will go and start a corporation which will be a separate taxable entity from myself. 

This corporation will be created with the soul purpose of taking on a clients and managing their finances for them, in their name.  We will have only one client. Me.

I will hire 4 accountants.

2 of the 4 accountants will manage the movement of money out of my account and into the companies. 
This accountant will provide me with a single Invoice Marked Paid, for the dollar amount that was drawn from my bank account daily.
 
This will satisfy the requirements of Op and have something to show for it category. And bring my account to 0.00

And then I will direct the corporation to do my bidding with a wish list of :

* Stuff I want
* Things I want to do
* Charities I want to support
* Etc.

I will then have the company Hire 2 lawyer, and 2 personal assistant, and 2 Assistant Manager.

The Lawyers will protect me from the vindictiveness of Ops Rules, The Assistant Managers will sign off on documents for managing the corporation, and manage the entire team for me. The Personal assistants will manage my affairs for me and my wishlist, and the Managers will report to them.

Why double?

Because the employees need time off, and they can be part time. Maybe they work 1 week and take the next week off, or they alternate. Doesn't really matter, I will let the Managers determine employee Scheduling. I don't want to have to handle that. 

The last 2 accountants will do payroll. Someone's got to handle payment of my corporations employees. 

Each employee is budgeted to receive 1000 a day, inclusive of all payroll costs for taxes and deduction. 

10 employees, 10,000 expense. Still got 10,000 spending power daily through the corporation.

"If you either have reasonable levels of patience or are highly functional at multitasking, you can make breakfast burritos.  For your convenience, I will type out the whole recipe I use. 

Now, you may not consider breakfast burritos to be ""seemingly impressive.""  But you're wrong.  You need to taste them.  When done properly, they are... Beyond burritos.  Burritos that will elevate you to god status among your peers.  These also make excellent morning-after breakfasts after a hookup.

**TL;DR: Burrito recipe**


What you need to know how to do:

* Dice potatoes (does not have to be even) 
* Cut up an onion into manageable chunks (dice, slice, whatever feels good to you and your burrito)
* Scramble eggs
* Brown chorizo (i.e. throw a pound of ground pork into a hot pan and stir it around until it looks cooked)
* Heat oil and stir things around in oil
* Scoop sour cream out of a container with a spoon
* Locate a grocery store with jars of premade green chili or salsa, depending on what kind of person you are
* Soften tortillas by microwaving them for about 30 seconds
* Sprinkle shredded cheese with your fingers into a tortilla
* Roll up a tortilla with stuff in the middle

What you need:

* A sharp knife (you can get a pretty great chef's knife at Walmart for about 10 dollars, worth every penny)
* A cutting board
* Some pans to cook in -- one of those deep 10-inch cooker pans for deep frying (Also available at Walmart for ten dollars), whatever kinds of frying pan you cook your hamburger helper in for meat and eggs
* A bowl to mix your eggs in and some kind of stick like a fork or a whisk to stir them with
* A plate with a paper towel on top to put your greasy potatoes on (kind of like when you take bacon out of a pan)
* Foil to wrap your burritos in to take to your friends/coworkers/booty call
* Food to cook and put into burritos

Food you need:

* Eggs
* Potatoes
* Chorizo (you can find it next to the ground pork in the grocery store)
* An onion
* Tortillas (Fun fact: Chipotle will sell you individual tortillas for 39 cents each.)
* Shredded cheese (Mexican blend or cheddar work best)
* Sour cream, green chili, salsa if you like those things
* Beans if you REALLY like beans.  These are totally optional.
* Some kind of southwestern-style spice mix.  Mrs. Dash is a wonderful example.  You should also use salt and pepper.  Do not season your chorizo under any circumstances.
* Vegetable oil.  A bunch of it.

The fundamental concept of a breakfast burrito is that it is a tortilla with potatoes and eggs inside.  The rest is an exercise for the cook.  I've never failed with this recipe before, though.

Here's what you do:

**Frying potatoes**

You need some potatoes.  Depends on how many burritos you're making.  If you're doing large potatoes, I've found that one potato works for 3-4 burritos.  Depends on your potato and tortilla size, other ingredients you put in, etc, etc.  Now, you can peel your potatoes, or you can leave the skins on if that feels better to you, but you definitely need to wash your potatoes.  Put them under cold water in the sink and scrub.  Any knots sticking out of the side should be cut out.  Those are bad for you.  Next, dice your potato.  This isn't hard.  Look it up on Youtube if you don't know how.  Go for small chunks, the kind you'd want to see in a breakfast burrito from a food truck.  

While you've been busy washing and dicing your potatoes, you should have your deep pan with a nice deep puddle of oil in it -- maybe half an inch deep, enough to cover the bottom half of your potato chunks -- on the burner, medium heat, to get the oil hot.  Dump the potatoes from your cutting board into the pan and listen to the crackle of deep-fried potatoes.  Just like Grandma Wendy used to make.  Stir them around with a spatula every so often.  

*How do I know they're done?*  Good question! You'll find that raw potatoes are tough and starchy, and would be crunchy if you took a bite.  When your potatoes are done, they should feel crispy against your spatula rather than just firm.  If you're uncertain, stab one with a fork and let it cool so you can take a bite out of it.  It's not a perfect science, but you'll know it when you feel it.

Once your potatoes are done, you can strain out the oil in a colander (provided your garbage disposal is equipped to deal with hot oil -- do not rinse them) or scoop them out with your spatula.  Either way, put them on a plate with a paper towel on top until you're ready to assemble your burrito.  Immediately sprinkle some salt and pepper on your potatoes (unless you put a bunch of salt on them right when you dropped them in the pan, which works too I guess) before the oil starts draining off.   Crispy potatoes are what separate the men from the boys when it comes to homemade breakfast burritos.

**Cooking chorizo**

You can get a pound of raw chorizo from the grocery store.  Get the kind in the shrink-wrapped Styrofoam, not the kind in the roll.  If you like, get some middle-shelf tequila too.  It adds nice flavor to the meat and you can also take shots of it.

Cut up your onion as you warm your frying pan.  The best kind of breakfast burrito onions are not crispy, but rather caramelized in tequila and chorizo fat.  Once your onion is cut up, throw your chorizo in the pan and break it up with your spatula.  Midway through browning your meat, chuck your onion shrapnel into the pan and stir it around to cook it.  Drizzle a shot of tequila around your pan if you got some. Your meat and onions should be cooked at about the same time. The onions will be soft and brown and sweet, but not squishy and slimy and disgusting.  Drain the fat from your pan and set it aside until you are ready to assemble your burrito.


**Preparing your eggs**

If you don't know how to scramble eggs by this point, I'm not really able to help you with that.  But when you're whisking up your eggs in your mixing bowl, use a generous dose of your Mrs. Dash to give them some flavor.  Maybe a bit of milk or sour cream to soften them up too.  Cook your eggs well-done, nothing worse than slimy scrambled eggs in a breakfast burrito.

**Assembling your burrito**

The biggest mistake a rookie makes when putting together a breakfast burrito is overloading it.  The goal here is to avoid tortilla breakage, as needing to wash your hands after eating defeats the purpose of the breakfast burrito.  Start out by softening your tortillas.  Put a stack of them on a plate, cover with a damp paper towel, and microwave them until they're warm. (30-60 seconds, depending on the number of tortillas.)  Put your tortilla down on a square of foil (like they do at Chipotle) and start scooping.  Go easy, though -- you have a lot of different elements to put on this burrito and just a little bit of each will still add up to a lot of food.  Start out by scooping your condiments (sour cream, green chili, salsa) onto the middle of the tortilla.  Use them sparingly.  Spread them around with a spoon.  Then scoop your potatoes, eggs, and meat-onion monstrosity.  Sprinkle some cheese on there, too.  If you don't know a good burrito-wrapping technique, consult YouTube.  Wrap them in foil, or put them on a plate to eat immediately. This may require some trial and error.  Be sure to eat your mistakes -- you've earned it.

It's that simple -- Salt, pepper, Mrs.. Dash, and food all in a tortilla.  If you can't multitask, it's okay to focus on one element at a time.  Godspeed.",2015-05-29 16:19:14,NetflixIronman,31

Take your cut (I prefer ribeye) let it come to close to room temperature and season both sides with kosher salt and coarse black pepper.  Preheat your cast iron to medium, and your oven to 350,  Put a pat on butter on your steaks and put them on the cast iron, sear them 1-3 minutes per side for a nice crust.

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.

Brown up some beef. Thrown in salt, pepper, a little bit of onion and garlic. Once it's all browned and drained, thrown in a cup of condensed mushroom soup and a little bit of milk. Let it get warm in the skillet. Pour it into the bowl of bread. Mix it all up. Stuff the French bread with this. Throw a bunch of cheese on top, I like cheddar. You can also add greens if that's your thing. 

Put it on a baking sheet and throw it in the oven for 10-15 minutes.

It takes 30 minutes to cook, and it's so delicious.

* 1 each - white onion, red/green bell pepper, diced
* 3-4 stalks celery, sliced
* 3-4 jalapenos, diced
* 1 can diced/crushed tomatoes, 15-20oz
* 1 habanero, minced
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 chicken breasts, chopped into inch cubes
* 1 lb andouille sausage, cubed/sliced
* 1 lb frozen/pre-shelled shrimp
* 2 tbs Cajun seasoning
* 1 tbs cayenne
* 1 tbs thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 cups rice
* 4 cups chicken stock
* Louisiana-style vinegar-based hot sauce, I like Crystal or Louisiana brands.

Take diced veggies and garlic, cook until tender. Add sausage and chicken, brown. Add the rest of the ingredients, bring to a boil, lower to simmer, let it cook for 30 minutes or so until the rice is tender, stirring regularly to ensure nothing sticks. Add shrimp during the last ~5 minutes. This shit is amazing. Add more hot sauce when it's done.

It's one thing to be 10 minutes late, that's acceptable. But nothing drives me crazier than people who are habitually 20 or 30 minutes late every single time.

To me, that says that they don't value my time at all. The people I know that are chronically late aren't bad people and I know they don't mean anything by it, but it's like they're in their own world. Like time doesn't mean anything to them and they'll come whenever they want.

I have one friend who's particularly bad. She's very flakey and will always be late, if she even shows up at all. She'll never call ahead of time to say that she's late or not coming at all, and when I try to call her, she suddenly becomes impossible to reach. She's one of my best friends and I know it's not personal, since she does the same thing to everyone. She's also one of the nicest people I know, she just doesn't really pay attention to time.

One time, I was hanging out with a few friends who all met at my house at 5. At 5:30, I saw her still on Facebook at home and I messaged her, and she said she was about to leave. By 7, she still hadn't left her house. At 8, she called me to tell me that she couldn't come because she got pulled over for speeding, since she was trying to get to my house fast after being so late, and her mom wanted her back home after that.

"A car I bought and a necklace I gave a girl.. 

Bit of a story behind this one.. I think when we started dating I was 16 and she was 14, so you still very new to the world of 'love' and relationships. She lived an hour away from me, and was literally the reason I got my license ASAP and saved up a car. Every cent I earned pretty much went into keeping this 15 year old shit fighter alive / full of fuel so I could see her.

One day, she made an off hand comment about how it sucked that I never actually bought her anything.. Which kinda hurt, but I thought fuck it, she is right. So I saved up. I searched. In the end, I settled on what I could only describe as the perfect opal, had all the right colours, was very pleasing on the eye, set into a little gold  pendant on a very fine, gold chain.

When I gave it to her, she literally cried. It was the first gift she'd ever received from anybody. She wore it everywhere. She never took it off. I can't even begin to describe what it used to do to my nearly 17 year old self to see her wearing that, and only that. She was just beautiful.

After I turned 17, I had to move to the other end of the country for a year for study, and being the tender ages of 17 and 15, we believed we could make long distance work, cause you know, them dreams of marriage, right?

Well.. The inevitable happened. We fought the entire year. We made up for the entire year. We broke up. We got back together. I finished my study, and I drove home. I drove that same shitfighter back to our side of the country 4,000km away. She didn't know I was coming back home at this stage.. And when I walked into her work to surprise the now 16 year old girl who I had fallen into that puppy love with, you can't even describe how I felt when I saw her wearing that necklace.

Then came what was mostly 6 months of bliss.. I got a new car, but kept the old shitfighter. She was doing great in school, things seemed great.

But it was shortlasted.. She grew distant.. And then stopped talking to me altogether.. Everytime I visited her, she wouldn't look at me, she wouldn't speak, she wouldn't say a word.. This went on for a month.. In the end, on a Monday, I went over I told her I couldn't do it anymore, couldn't keep talking to myself, and said I was going to give her some space until she sorted her headspace out. On the Friday.. She was dating one of the Army blokes that get stationed here where I live from interstate..

A week later, I received a letter in the mail, with two words - ""I'm Sorry"" and the necklace..

The next few months were hell. The torment of wondering how long it had gone on for drove me insane. At 18, I believed this girl was going to be my life. I gave her everything I could. I was there for her through the depression, through the self harm, through everything.. And I lost it all to some tosser in a uniform and nice car.. I actually went mad trying to reason it all out.

So one night.. I got in that old shitfighter, wearing that necklace, and I lined up the powerpole at the end of the road 3km away.. And then I began accelerating. I hit 190km/h by the time I left the road. But then I missed the power pole, and rolled the car 4 times, and somehow walked away from the wreck.. One week later, I destroyed the necklace. Broke every linkage. Turned the rock to dust.. And put it in an envelope and gave it straight back to her.

They say your soulmate isn't the person you have the most in common with, but the person who feels like home. I felt like our relationship was home. No amount of other relationships of any depth or commitment with completely different girls were the same.

But.. I grew up, and just like real life, when you grow up, you move out of home. My future doesn't lie at what feels like home.

Nicole, I hope you're doing okay. I hope he makes you happy.

TLDR - Wrecked a car and a necklace, both of which I bought because of puppy love for a girl

"Around the time the Xbox 360 came out I'm sure a lot of you remember the dreaded ""red ring of death"".

Well I was playing a game (can't remember which one) when I got the red ring of death and as you can imagine, I was [platinum mad](http://i.imgur.com/eExHDsL.jpg). Still, I kept my composure and managed to get it swapped for a new one at the local game store. 

A couple of weeks later I was playing Oblivion when all of a sudden, boom, red rings on the NEW console. I was really mad so I grabbed it and shook it while shouting ""YOU PIECE OF SHIT""

Terrible idea. 

Shaking the console while it was turned on made the laser burn up the disk and completely fuck it. That was it, that was the final straw...

I basically ripped the console out of my TV stand and ran downstairs. I then proceeded to open the door to the garden and I threw it as far as I could causing it to bounce off one of the stepping stones in the garden. But it wasn't over... I then ran up up to the pond and grabbed a giant rock that was placed next to it for decoration, from there I smashed the console about 15 times until most of my rage was gone.

After that I just sat there, looking at the pieces scattered everywhere with a big shit-eating grin on my face. I then had to buy another one for like £300 which was a lot for me at the time but it was worth it, it needed to be done. It must have served as a spiritual warning to the next one because I never had a problem with it and it's still running perfectly to this day.

**Edit** I'm getting quite a few people saying ""Microsoft could have replaced it regardless of warranty"", I already knew that at the time but after having two consoles fail on me in less than 3 weeks I wasn't exactly in the mood to just accept it as bad luck and move on. Hence the reason I'm posting my story in this thread and not a thread titled ""What non living thing made you so mad that you stopped what you were doing, calmed down and then got on with your day?""

"The fucking coffee maker that belonged to my yuppie uncle.

God bless all of them.  My family has my now deceased grandmother's summer home and it is shared by several branches of the family.  The place is tucked up on a mountain with breathtaking views of the Smoky Mountains.  A steaming cup of coffee on the deck on a crisp morning is one of life's simple pleasures.  It is an experience that calms the soul and restores balance and order in an otherwise hectic existence.  At least, it has the potential to do all of those things.

My yuppie uncle's side of the family has a habit of ""gifting"" the cabin stuff that his primary residence no longer uses or needs.  He and his family are accustomed to a certain standard of living, as we all are, but their standard of living results in some sometimes bizarre and impractical standards.  I think that's how we wound up with the piece of shit coffee maker.  It was one of those European jobs that has a double-insulated carafe that doesn't keep the coffee hot, odd-sized filters that aren't readily available in the grocery store, a near impossible-to-secure locking lid, and an overall tempermental assembly that loves to flood the countertops with coffee grinds and lukewarm coffee.  Really and truly, my $15 Black and Decker from Wal-Mart is superior in every possible way.  The problem is we couldn't POSSIBLY have something so plain in a mountain summer home.  

So, I get up, cuss the coffee maker and go through the systems check to make sure that slot A lines up with notch B and the lid is properly secured to the carafe that is roughly the size of a gallon jug, but only holds about a pint and a half of liquid.  I mop up the water that was spilled on the countertop and press the start sequence to a chorus of electronic beeps while this utter hunk of shit reads my brain frequencies to determine how to best ruin my morning.

I go downstairs, kick over a load of laundry, and wake up the SO for a steaming hot cup of Joe.  My usually dead to the world girlfriend must be in-tune with the fucking coffee monster because in a rare display of morning clarity, she opts to follow me upstairs and into the kitchen.

The fucking coffee maker has deposited roughly five gallons of coffee water and fifteen pounds of coffee grounds all over the countertops, filled two kitchen drawers with coffee diarrhea water and as a final fuck you, drained even more coffee water into the storage cabinets below, which is interesting, because had I wanted an actual cup of coffee, I would have had about 6 oz. to work with. 

It was over for the demon machine.  In a rare display of utter frustration and completely lacking any semblance of defeat, I jerked the cord out of the wall, drug the machine outside, and slung that son of a bitch off of the deck like an Olympic hammer thrower.  Had it not smashed into a tree, I an 100% convinced that I could have cleared most of the mountain.  

After cleaning up the mess left by the now ejected coffee maker, I trundled down to the local Wal Mart to pick up a tried-and-true coffee maker, complete with auto shut-off and genuine glass pot.  I enjoyed every drop produced by that machine.

Later in the month, my yuppie uncle asked about the old coffee maker and I told him that it broke and it was no longer around, but the good news is it was replaced new coffee maker that functioned much better than the old one.

Turns out, demon monster was about $400.

"Galactic Civilization 2.  I didn't destroy the game, but one of the races in the game.  Utterly destroyed them.

I was Human, the aforementioned race was the Drengin.  We were roughly comparable in size of our Empires, but I was more technologically powerful.  They kept harassing my scouts, building starbases near my borders and violating my borders with their own warships.  I kept warning them that this type of behavior would not go unpunished.  They never listened, they mocked me that I would never be able to do anything against them. This went on for what seemed like forever.  

Then they had the audacity to declare war on my civilization and destroyed my surveyor, the one you start the game with.  The game had progressed so many turns that the ship was the longest serving ship I had in my fleet by *decades*.  I decided enough was enough.  I geared all 200+ of my planets for war.  All technological advancements went to military research, nearly all planetary improvements were put on hold for military production.  It was as close to total war as one could get.

Once I had amassed an armada of military transports and ships ready for combat, I began my crusade.  Their home world was at the far corner of their empire.  Perhaps the A.I believed that they would be safe from my might. Maybe it was that attitude that emboldened the A.I to behave like it did.  But I was patient.  *I would burn every single world they possessed.*

It took dozens, *scores* of turns, thousands upon thousands of credits spent, billions of inconsequential lives represented by bits of code.  But I made it to their home world.  I had amassed a fleet of twenty military transports, each carrying over a half a billion soldiers each and so many warships that I lost count of their number.  There was no hope for the Dregin.  Every ship that they would produce would be burned out of existence.  As their planet hung below my armada, I contemplated on simply having my military transports drag an asteroid into the planet, destroying much of the infrastructure on the world, but leaving its destruction as an example to the rest of the galaxy.  But before I could launch the final assault on them, I got a transmission from the leader of the Drengin empire.

""You have crushed our civilization utterly.  The long war between us has proven that your civilization is more powerful. We cannot hope to defeat you.  We surrender.""

I was elated, and yet disappointed.  I had been denied the final blow against their empire.  But why should I be sad. I had doubled the size of my empire to span half of the galaxy by pure conquest.  The rest of the galaxy would not, could not hope to ever best me in anything that they did.  I had a hegemony on the rest of the galaxy.  And it felt *great.*",2015-05-29 09:03:52,Rockdio,143

"**Randy Marsh:** Alright, now listen kids. There's some things that we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths. This is called 69ing, and it's normal.

**Sharon Marsh:** You see boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it feels good to have a man's penis inside of it.

**Sheila Broflovski:** That's right. But sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle.

**Gerald Broflovski:** Now, on the double penetration boys, you see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.

**Randy Marsh:** That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.

**Sheila Broflovski:** It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.

**Randy Marsh:** Going number one or number two on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.

"I think I can add my lifelong experiences to this. I am from a very low caste - scheduled caste. I am 32 years old and have lived one fourth of my life in North America. Let me explain first what being SC means in India.




First, and most important when you meet someone and they ask your last name, you know they will know your caste and you can feel their judging eyes in your bones and you can’t do shit. 32 years and it still makes me nervous to mention someone my last name and my last name doesn’t even give away my caste. However, just because my family name doesn’t give away my caste they just ask it and I can see their silent judgement. Oh and if any of you think it could be my psychological issue, No it’s not; everyone I know from my caste and other lower castes, feel the same way. 




Everyone in my family has either Masters from western universities or PhD from very reputed Indian universities and are in very good professional positions and still we are often discriminated against. We can’t buy or rent houses / apartments in most of the residential colonies. And, this is in Ahmedabad, the place where our honorable prime minister used to contend for his state legislative assembly. Most of our relatives who bought or rented apartments / houses in last 2-3 years were asked by the builders what caste they belong to and upon finding that they belong to lower cast were denied housing. Builders don’t have problems selling houses or apartments but they fear one or two lower caste family will alienate other upper caste families from their colonies and will lower the market price.




Oh and police behavior is more or less same as USA police has towards black community (Assumption on my part so no offence to USA police members).




And marriage is a whole lot different thing. My brother married to a Brahmin girl. He had to spend more than two years to convenience the girl’s parents to allow him to get married to their daughter. Now in normal Indian marriage scenario, he shouldn’t have any problem since he’s highly educated, very well earning and a very handsome young man and as per Indian arranged marriage scenario he’s a catch. And, he still was not allowed in her home for more than two years even though he was dating her for over five years and she was treated as a family member in our house.




And most important, I and most of my family members were asked what caste we belong to In Delhi and Mumbai Airports, In Toronto India Community, In NewYork Indian Community. The very first time I went to Toronto the first person I meet from my state Gujarat was a Patel and first thing he asked me was what caste I belong to.





I agree that we don’t have much caste issue in big cities on general level such as sharing food or getting promotion but you know that subtle discrimination, that silent judging, that constant need to prove yourself because you’re from lower caste, that facial expression of higher caste people when they find your caste, etc. are some of the things can never leave you with peace. I think India needs another 100 or may be more years to completely remove caste. And I can understand that, I mean India just got free 68 years ago, it’s still a very young country. Look at USA, how many years they took to accept black, How many years they took to elect a black president and do they yet have a female president?

"Yes, younger generation doesn't give shit about in day to day life. But, when it comes to marriage, everybody prefer someone from same caste because of family pressure.

If X marries someone outside caste, their siblings might struggle to find someone from same caste. Majority still find their SO through arrange marriages and being considerate thing towards family members, most of us get married within same caste.

It's important because in older times ""Roti &amp; beti"" ( bread  &amp; bride) transactions used to happen within same caste. Nobody gives shit anybody eating with anybody anymore. But, getting married outside caste still is taboo because reasons above. 

We have made progress, but there is still long way to go.

Another aspect keeping this thing alive is short sighted politician are pro reservation in colleges and govt jobs. This obviously make being from lower caste a ""privilege"", as you can get into to college/govt job even with minimum score required for qualification. This doesn't help higher caste guys being fan of lower caste guys. If some brave politician removes reservation (currently 50%+), he is committing political suicide. 

This is what happens in so called urban/progressive India.

In rural India ( in handful places), it's still crime getting married outside caste. If you are unlucky guy, you get killed on sight. If you are unlucky girl, you will be raped and then killed. 

tl;dr: Arranged marriages(which is still in majority), caste is preferences. In education and govt jobs, lower cast is privilege. And, some places one might get raped and/or killed for marrying outside caste.

"I posted this elsewhere, but here goes...

Most people I know are completely against this system. It means nothing to us anymore. Being born into a so called higher caste family means nothing. It's not like we earned it, it's not like we're even doing the traditional 'work' the caste was supposed to do. I have no idea what castes my friends belong to, and even those who are so called lower castes, I couldn't care less.

There are some people in my family (older generations) who would, well, prefer that we marry within the caste etc. It doesn't go beyond that at all, and eventually caste isn't a deal breaker, just a preference for some people. There are plenty of cousins and aunts and uncles in my family who've married outside the caste, religion, state, country etc etc

I thought that's how it was for everyone, or atleast in the cities, but evidently not. My sister once met someone on the metro (subway?), they found out they were in the same college and started making small talk, and that other girl apparently asked her her caste and then kind of took on a very meek demeanour and kind of slunk away when she realised my sister was of a 'higher' caste. So that makes me feel, maybe there are people who really have to deal with it on a regular basis. It's always easy to say 'DOESNT EXIST' when it doesn't affect you, and I can't imagine my family being oppressed because of caste.

"Yay a question which I consider myself qualified to answer (Sociologist and Indian).

The rigidity of the caste system varies widely in India, there is vast gap in perception between the urban and rural populace when it comes to caste. In urban areas you will find some amount caste-based discrimination, especially in interactions between the urban rich and urban poor (most rich people generally belong to higher castes). There are also instances of nepotism at the workplace based on caste and religion. The group with the biggest problems with caste are the middle class, this is actually a modern problem arising out of the government's policy of reservation/quotas in jobs and education. 

In the rural areas you still can find enormous caste based discrimination. Lynching, untouchability, segregation are all daily occurrences. 

The youth in general reflect the values of the society in which they were raised. Urban youth are far more inclusive and generally do not assign much value to caste whereas, rural youth still stick on to certain elements of the system and do not mix much with other castes (they generally stay with other youth from their own caste).",2015-05-29 12:05:48,na_vij,11

Don't live in India anymore but visit family every year. My family is very political (moms side) and my paternal grandparents did very well in the oil industry.

The worst thing I despise is how they treat them, for example moms brothers won't even pick up a glass in front of them and make the butler come and give it in their hands. Pathetic. And if they don't do it quickly they get hit. Hence I came to America and told myself I will recreate my luxurious lifestyle from India here and treat everyone as a human. 

I would live a million lives in poverty then treat anyway that way. This is what makes America great, you can be homeless and make your way up to the top. And my cousins there perpetuate the same thought process so for me caste system is hit or miss.

"This is my experience and I strongly oppose making sweeping generalizations about a culture as a whole, but I'll share my experiences. 

I'm a white American (from the bible belt) married to a first generation Tamil Brahmin. [More info on the Brahmin caste.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin) In addition, I have worked with and befriended a lot of Indians over the past 10 years. The Indians I have worked with are in their 20's, while my wife and I just hit 40. I also have a good relationship with my wife's parents and extended family, in the 60-80 year old generation.  In may experience, the difference in attitudes is very visible between these generations, and even more visible between my wife and her parents. 

Young Generation:
In my experience (I know I keep repeating this), most of the younger generation (20 somethings) don't care, whatsoever.  They find my marriage fascinating and want me to meet their parents. I have run into a few situations where people cared, but even those people were somewhat chastised when they spoke out about it in social settings. The exception would be some of my relatives living in rural portions of India that don't see a lot of the outside world. 

Middle Age Generation:
When I met my wife, she literally believed that Brahmins had a genetic predisposition that made them superior to other Indians in certain aspects. An example, in her state, Brahmans speak a different dialect of Thamil than other Indians and she thought (because it had been hammered into her head for her whole life) that only Brahman's could do that. She now realizes this is total bullshit. BTW, it took almost 2 years before I could get her parents to take me seriously. (I could go on for pages about this, but it is off topic.)  

Older Generation:
As I mentioned previously, I have a good relationship with my wife's parents and our extended family. That being said, the beliefs they hold with regard to their caste are deep seeded and pervasive with regard to everyday life. Knowing what I know now, after 9 years of marriage), I'm astounded that I was able to break through the barriers I have. In my family (and I do consider this my own family), the older generation typically, with a single exception, come from generations of other Brahmins and have married into the same caste exclusively. The food is different for them, the language is different for them, my marriage ceremony (we married in Chennai) was different.  They truly believe in a genetic heritage that sets them apart as Brahmins. There are times when I want to choke someone for going on and on about a bunch of Brahmin bullshit.That being said, ALL of them have accepted me openly. And since my wife and I got married, there seems to be a bit more of a liberal attitude regarding marriage, and the caste exclusivity (is that a word?)

I hope this helps answer your question. I'm typing this between meetings at work, so let me know if anything is unclear.",2015-05-29 10:26:58,phenolic72,19
"Yes and no. On a day to day basis no one cares about caste during social interactions or just anything normal people do. The only time young people care about caste is if/when:    
  
a. Affirmative actions, or caste-based reservations in educational institutions and public/private jobs comes up. One school of thought is that a statistically significant percentage of people use these ""reservations"" to freeload off and game the system, diluting the quality of education in the country. Another school of thought feels that people have been kept down by the upper castes for way too long, so they want to succeed too, even if it means gaming the system.  
  
(I have no say in this matter, as I've lived as an uppercaste guy in urban India. I have no idea how it is in actual India.)
  
b. The only other time people speak about castes is when deriding the political parties for running caste based political campaigns. Its kind of stupid to see people still identifying by caste, and politicians are being dickweeds and manipulating these people as they are wont to do. Its sad but that's the nature of politics.  
  
c. In marriage ads in the classifieds in the newspaper, most ads involve caste based groom/bride selection. Nothing makes me sadder than this, because it shows how far India has to go before this caste bullshit disappears for good.",2015-05-29 09:26:22,imnoidiot5,6

"Not really. Arranged marriages are still pretty much decided on the basis of caste and most young Indians often succumb to parental pressure and marry that way, even the ones who come from money. There is still around 50% reservation in the government jobs and institutions of learning for 'lower caste' people. This is being misused quite a lot by people who don't really need any kind of reservation because they are economically well off while people who genuinely need it suffer because their seats are hogged by these guys. This also creates a little implicit casteism in the young urban people because they see a lot of these strongly fought for seats being granted to the undeserving.

In rural India and amongst the Urban poor (which is the majority of the population) the caste system is still a big big deal. A 60 year old guy in the Indian state of Rajasthan once refused to share a pipe with my friend there because my friend is a Brahmin (higher caste) and the old chap said something on the lines of ""I'll be insulting my beliefs by thinking I'm equal to you and sharing something I have tasted with you"" ( he was a lower caste guy and had asked for his caste first).",2015-05-29 07:31:46,ssasmisltlywll,16

"I must emphasize that India is a HUGE country. It is a hodgepodge of several distinct cultures that change with geography, with social class, and with other things. Whatever answer you get will depend on the personal experiences of the author (and reddit will get a HUGELY, HUGELY biased sample because an Indian redditor is very likely to be a young educated IT English-speaking professional from a merchant or Brahmin caste family. Of course, this covers a very tiny fraction of the population.

Personally, I couldn't care less about caste. I am in the US as a student. I don't know any of my Indian friends' castes (except for those whose caste is obvious from their surnames), and I don't want to know, so I never asked. Likewise, no one has asked me about my caste, though it's not obvious from my surname. I think this attitude is thankfully becoming more common, at least among the educated class. However, casteism is still rampant in the interior villages (which constitute the majority of the country's population).

I will admit that marriages are the last bastion of casteism. For instance, my parents are highly educated engineers, yet if they try to arrange my marriage I'm sure that they will not search outside our caste. This is not just because they feel our caste is superior, but also because they believe that anyone brought up in a different caste is likely to be culturally different enough to cause problems later. For example, I am a Brahmin; they will not even search for Brahmins whose native language is not ours, even if they are fluent in the other language or the other person is fluent in ours. Remember that personal attraction plays little role in Indian marriages; it is more like a marriage of one family with another than a marriage of one person with another. They believe that they may be culturally incompatible with a Brahmin family who natively speak another language.

Personally, I hope this rot is weeded out from Indian society as soon as possible.",2015-05-29 17:11:26,rpfeynman18,5

"I can tell you among the women, it's pretty important to look like they are upper class. They want to be light skinned, and will put a lot of money in brightening spa treatments....even going so far in getting pretty shady beauty products that guarantee skin bleaching.

Normally brightening skincare has AHA's to chemically exfoliate, retinol to do the same plus lighten, and specific botanical ingredients. Even in small amounts, you need to wear sunscreen because these treatments leave the skin extra vulnerable to sun damage. Getting something someone concocted can be seriously hazardous, some have bleach in them.  That's going to, at the least, cause irritation and chemical burns. At the most, possibly cancer and/or permanent thinning/weakening of the skin.

On the cosmetic end, I have been scolded for applying foundation that matched the client's skin shade. This is a big no. Take the accurate color, then lighten it 2-4 shades. Fuck it if it makes the client look pasty/sickly. She's fair and that's all that matters. Just blend that shit as best as you can down the neck. It's frustrating from my point of view, because it looks so unnatural and odd, but the client is always pleased from it. But when it comes to wedding makeup, it's a must.

"I was a resident of the oldest, most well-known prison in my state.  I was there for a relatively harmless crime(I don't want to debate this..but it was drugs).  I was in there with murderers, rapists, and people serving life.  I realized there is so much to learn from these people -- and anyone, really.  Many of these men were filled with so much wisdom -- often regret for the choices that a younger, more impulsive self had made.  When they spoke to me, I recognized it for what it was -- they looked at me and saw themselves, and so they would speak to me gently..patiently..but still assertively..in an almost 'learn from this' way.  What they maybe didn't know?  That when I looked at them, I saw MYSELF too.  What would become of me if I continued doing what I was doing -- acting, talking, and treating other people how I had been.

The impact going to prison had on me was profound, and I still harken back to those days(three years ago).  I'm currently in recovery from addiction -- and I'm blessed to be alive today.  My life is..so much different now than at any point in my life.

The other person walks in behind them and continues to scan while the first person watches behind them until the door is closed. I've been assaulted 3 times and once was entering a building.

Another thing about spending a lot of time in prison is a fear of silence. Prisons are noisy. Very noisy. Nothing I have ever experienced was more frightening than a dead quiet chow hall.

Edit: ""12"" is explained in a reply below.






Edit 2:

A few things about doing DOC time that a lot of people seem to be bewildered by, just because I'm bored.

- Most people think of cell blocks when they think of jail. [Dorms like this](http://imgur.com/dZJ0jta) are more typical unless you're maximum-security... at least here in Louisiana, the prison capital of the world (yes, we have the highest incarceration rate in the world)

- The things people get in jail is bewildering... Actual knives are common (real knives, not shanks) in many jails - I've seen dudes fighting with big ass kitchen knives. Some jails will have a gun or two in them. At a DOC camp in Bunkie (I believe? Maybe it was East Carroll), items found during a huge shakedown included a pistol and a bulletproof vest. Drugs are everywhere. Cell phones are everywhere.

- Anything illicit is bought with ""dots"" (well, in camps that don't allow cash) - you get your people to go to the store and get a Green Dot Moneypak and give you the number, you give the number to the person you're buying from, they call and ""run the numbers"", you get your shit, then they either load the dot onto their prepaid card or have someone do it for them. If paying with stuff from commissary, you may pay as high as 200% sometimes. Typically, a Suboxone strip in jail would go for $50-80 cash/dot and $140 commissary.
If you borrow something from someone you're not cool with, it's an unspoken rule that you pay them back double (i.e. 2 packs of cigarettes when ""store day"" comes in exchange for 1 now)


- COs (guards) won't hesitate to spray you with mace or beat the ever living fuck out of you for simply looking at them a certain way (or it being perceived that you're looking at them a certain way). This will NEVER change and the guards rarely ever get in trouble for it.

- A lot of guards do more dirt than the prisoners. Bringing drugs in, accepting bribes to let an inmate escape for a little while (just be back before head count), arranging ass-beatings, etc.

- Prisons have something called the ""goon squad"" - a stormtrooper unit that officially doesn't exist, yet is the warden's personal ass-beating administration unit. Inmate been causing problems or cutting up too bad? The goon squad will be sent to beat the fuck out of him... Broken bones and worse are pretty much expected in some prisons if the goon squad comes.

- Medical care? ROFL. They'll literally watch you die and not give two shits.

- EVERYTHING is done via a form. Inmate request forms, grievance forms / ARPs, medical request forms, shave pass request forms, etc. If you ever need something, the answer will be ""fill this form out"". Half of the time you won't get a response, and when you do it'll be days or months before you hear anything back.

- Inmates will often sew a pouch or pocket in the crotch area of their sweatpants or boxers - usually this pocket is made out of the material from old boxers - to tuck phones or drugs in if they get run up on by the guards. We used to call these pants ""tuckers"".

- The simplest tool / weapon to get? A razor blade. All you do is take the cheap disposable razor they give you and crack the tip in half and pull the blade out - it's a thin flexible super sharp razor. I cut my pinky to the bone one time trying to get one out when I didn't know what I was doing.


- **If you find a honey bun on your bed** you may want to think twice about eating it. Because someone is going to come to you wanting it back... And not just any honey bun, that same exact honey bun. Well, that or your butt.",2015-05-30 09:22:10,SoEntrepreneurial,528
"I got indicted at 18 and turned 20 and 21 inside of a federal prison. I was in on a gun charge and not drugs or anything else.   All in all it wasn't bad, the food sucked but for prison food it wasn't bad,  there wasn't really shit to do but it was prison and we had a movie theater that played recently released to pg13 dvd movies, there were good people and bad just like anywhere else just the contrast was more severe.  

Some of the things that i learned in there and have kept are...


Be a stand up guy and keep your word,  basically just say what you mean and do what you say. But i did this before i went.  


You find a group who do the above and you stick with them.  This is what's known as your car or the group of people that you hangout with. I thought that i did this before but being told on by my best friend dictates that i did not.  


Everyone in prison is an innocent philosopher. 


Good roommates make your time go fast, bad roommates make your time drag and ends with them in the hospital and you in the hole. 


I'm perfectly willing to fuck wiling to fuck off a few months of good time when the rat that they put into your room who refuses to take a shower starts to act tough.  See above.  


Don't talk about it be about it.  Or in other words,  when your actions speak for themselves you don't feel the need to run your mouth.  But i did this before i went also. 


He who hits first hits last and the fair fight is the one you lose.  


You can be friends with whoever you want but when shit goes down know where you stand.  


Burritos and nachos are awesome.  


When you tell the truth you skin it,  tap your forearm witch means that your telling the truth on your skin.  I still do this when people accuse me of lying reflexively and it makes funny conversations because no one believes me about being in prison. 


I love reading.  


Pay your debts and don't gamble more than you can afford.  


I still call child molesters chomos. 


The halfway house in downtown KC is worse than prison. You take all of the few good qualities prison puts in people and remove the threat of violence if they don't follow that because no one in a halfway house wants to fight and it's all gone. You're left with nothing but chomos and bitches that will do anything for a cigarett. 


I don't care how many cigarettes you can sneak into the halfway house when you try to brag about raping a twelve year-old girl and almost killing her. 


I will not let a chomo ride in the elevator with me and force him to take the stairs.

"I always assess situations  and ""size people"" up now.  I was excitable before but now I lay back and size everything up. Sounds like a small thing but it's helped me immensely in the real world.

I talk 60% less than I used to and listen more rather than talk.  This small thing has actually made people open up to me since they think you are interested. It's part of the human rapport issue and how it works. I don't give a shit about you, I just learned in prison the less you say to people, the better.

I eat three meals a day like in prison and no eating after 5pm . No snacking in between. I was the healthiest and lowest bf in prison eating three small, shitty meals a day. I noticed I don't need all that garbage protein shakes and such in between to get huge. I am massive now that the three meals are nutritious type meals and I don't eat after 5-6pm.

I am neat and tidy , almost OCD. This is VERY important in prison as a messy fuck will get you a beating, sometimes a very ,very bad beating.

"Well let's see:

I got very fucking good at reading people. I know a surprisingly lot about a person after I first meet them. How they talk, what they say, what they do with their eyes, etc - it all goes into a database in my brain which spits out a likely profile of the person.

I always sit with my back to the wall when I'm in restaurants or other places where people might be walking behind. I also keep a very close on the exits and I pay very close attention to who is in the place. Also, I've finally gotten out of the habit of sitting with my legs on the outside of the chair legs in case I need to jump up quickly. 

I learned this growing up, but one thing that is very fucking important in prison is to not fucking talk about people or anything they may or may not be doing behind their back. Also, don't ask questions, and if you're asked a question about someone else, you don't know the answer.

**As far as what to do if you find yourself going to prison, here's a few tips:**

Don't join a gang. I saw so many young kids go in and think they were getting protection and respect, but what they were getting was used. The best way not to find yourself in a fucked up situation is if you, and you alone, or responsible for your own actions, and not for the actions of any other knucklehead. 

Don't mess with the sissies. Seriously, they bring out the predators and you don't want to be involved in that shit. Even if you're gay as 3 boys fucking, just go jerk off in the bathroom like everyone else. You do not want to find yourself in a love triangle with a triple murderer and a boy that thinks koolaid is makeup.

Don't gamble. Just don't. Yes, it's boring as fuck, and yes it makes the time go by, but you are opening yourself up to a few different problems if you do it, so don't. 

Keep your word, don't break it for nothing.",2015-05-30 11:36:31,ApprovalNet,121

"2 years in juvenile secure and non secure. Even though it might seem like a kitty jail it is not. Many of my friends have been with me in juvenile and ""graduated"" to the next level of incarceration and they have all told me that juvi is just as bad or even worse as kids are younger, stupider, and more energetic.

Either case I seen some shit and been through the good and bad.


So I took a couple things with me fron my expierence.

I learned to believe in hard work pays off. Actually stepping up and being proactive for yourself and others will bring in positive results.

I learned to be super alert in a public environment. I tend to analyze every person with or with out interacting with them. This is also very useful when driving looking out for cops. 

I learned to respect everyone I meet regardless of their size, color, beliefs, sex and sexual preference. Seriously this really changes your perspective on life. You become a family with everyone going against one bigger enemy versus going against each other.

You learn to be independant. You go to jail alone to do your time and not to make friends. I came out with the same mentality.. I do things and things get done for myself and all by myself.
(However I these days I do try and drag my new good and postive friends along just to talk to and stuff during downtime)

Not everyone who goes to jail comes out with these type of lessons though..

Some are just in crazy situations where they become to point of crazy and paranoia. This can easily happen to absolutely anyone in jail. I consider myself very lucky. I also had a lot compared to my fellow inmates where some may have had no parents since they were able to speak or some have been homeless for years. These are some examples but again I consider myself very lucky and grateful.

Speakinf abour grateful, the biggest thing I think every ex inmate here can relate to is being grateful....

Once you've learned the workings of the legal system from actually being in the system, it's much easier not to get caught a second time, and I've done some things this month alone that would probably get me revoked.

Then you have stuff that will melt your skin for hours, depending on the quantity.

Edit: To give an insight of how terrible Napalm is, it's a kind of jelly like substance that sticks to your skin (if it's mixed with tar-like substances), once ignited, it can sustain extremely high temperatures for hours without necessarily burning.
So if one if exposed to Napalm, it will have to be scraped off, which is naturally followed by your burned skin and meat will come off with it, if you're lucky you haven't been cocooned in it.

But as technology increases and cost to launch satellites decreases we have more clutter up there. 

The idea is that if there were a big enough collision in space, it could potentially cascade into more collisions, which would in turn cascade into more collisions, etc etc. This could effectively make launching satellites (or any manned craft intended for extended stays in space) impossible, sending us into a sort of dark ages again.

It’s a theory about why the universe seems so filled with potential for life and yet we haven’t found it. It states that somewhere between pre-life and an advanced civilization that is capable of colonizing the stars, there’s a Great Filter that stops them and ends life. This means humans fit into one of these three scenarios: -We’re rare, meaning we’ve already passed the Great Filter, unlike other civilizations on other planets. -We’re the first, meaning conditions in the universe are only now life friendly and we’re among many on our way to the capability of colonization. -We haven’t hit the Filter yet, meaning we are fucked. If this one is true, it means finding life or proof of life on Mars or Europa would be awful news because it would almost certainly mean the Filter is still ahead of us instead of behind us.",2015-05-30 13:59:23,Donald_Keyman,596

"Brain in a vat

The brain in a vat is an element used in a variety of thought experiments intended to draw out certain features of our ideas of knowledge, reality, truth, mind, and meaning. It assumes the following; -The brain is the origin of all consciousness. -The brain operates on electrical impulses. -External stimuli can affect the way the brain operates. -Any external stimuli to the brain can be simulated to a degree that the brain cannot distinguish these simulated stimuli from natural stimuli. The point is that you could be a brain in a jar, being fed false impulses for your entire life by an external source, or you (still a brain in a jar) could be hallucinating your entire life from lack of stimuli. Solipism is an interesting school of thought that explores this concept in part.

This is a proposition that says an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future may retroactively punish those who did not assist in bringing about its existence. It resembles a futurist version of Pascal’s wager; an argument suggesting that people should take into account particular singularitarian ideas, or even donate money, by weighing up the prospect of punishment versus reward. Furthermore, the proposition says that merely knowing about it incurs the risk of punishment (Now you know about it. You know who to thank while you will be tortured).

"The fact that computers have lied to each other to win an experiment.
I read an article about a maze program that was made and many different OS's were put in a their primary goal was to get to the end of the maze. From here the different OS programs evolved by themselves to communicate with each other to help each other find the end. Then a Secondary goal was entered, and it was to find the end first. The primary goal was still just to find the end of the maze. A few of the programs then evolved to lie to the other programs, giving them false information on how to reach the end of the maze so that they would have a leg up.

"In China there is a law inherited from older times prohibiting sexual acts in a group. A rough translation is ""any gathering of more than three individuals above the age of 16 and full legal responsibilities, regardless of gender or marital status, with the intention to willingly engage in sexually promiscuous acts"" is a violation of that law.

It's very rarely enforced, though in one instance it was, and because neighbors reported them for the racket. There are petitions to remove or at least amend it to ""in public"" though.

[Edit: Just to clarify because this thing is visible now, even though I know most of the replies are joking, the specific ""willing participation"" is because this is meant to be a light-punishment law, only the organizers/people who suggested the idea and frequent participants are sentenced (I presume from the wording first-time participants aren't), and the maximum is five years in prison. When there's anyone unwilling involved then that just goes over to laws covering rape, and they carry far harsher punishments.

As for the over 16, that's because in China 16 is the age where an individual has ""capacity for criminal responsibility"" (translation messes it up). Not related to age of consent like I previously said, which as it turns out is actually 14...

Also yes, threesomes are fine, it specifically says ""more than three individuals"", the thought came to mind when I first saw it too...

Then it happened to one of the guys I went to school with. He talked about it on facebook, but I didn't believe him. It was too far-fetched. Stuff like that is public record, so I looked it up. Apparently he was pissing on a dumpster in an alley, passed out mid-piss, and a child and her father saw his penis at like 2am. Almost a year of legal bullshit later, he took a plea and he's now a registered sex offender.

It's utterly incomprehensible that such a miscarriage of justice could occur. At what point do the prosecutors step back and say ""Hey, wait a sec. Isn't this really fucked up?"" There is absolutely no intent provable, and no deviant sexual gratification could result from this act because he was **unconscious**. He wasn't waving his dick around at a playground or anything, he was just a man taking a leak behind a bar at closing time.

He was 25 and his life is now over. Call me a tin-foil hat conspiritard, but the only justification that I can think of is that prosecutors must get some sort of monetary kickbacks for inflating the charges as high as they possibly can.

"The world produces around 365 megatonnes of potatoes a year [source](http://nationalpotatocouncil.org/2014-potato-statistical-yearbook/#page/78)

I mean you could undersell everyone in potato prices. Potato futures traded at 1400 [last october](http://www.investing.com/commodities/potato), so that's 520000 rupees ($8500) for 15 tonnes of potato.

This values the potato market in the hundreds of billions (around $200b per year), presumably to capture the whole market you would have to undersell to around 50%, plus there's distribution costs to take into account, anyway you could easily see profits of 50b per year, making you around as large as apple.

To take over the world you could buy some islands and start your own country, invest in military tech or nuclear weapons, or just enjoy yourself as a playboy billionaire philanthropist. At least that's what i'd do if i had all those potatoes.",2015-05-31 08:27:54,hybridthm,2678

"First, flood market with potatoes. Every single shop, fast food store, etc. has your potatoes. They're so cheap that no one can compete and ends up moving to other crops since they can't make a profit. Now, once your potato hegemony is established, slowly roll back potato supply. Enough to cause some rise in prices but not enough for panic. 
All of a sudden, stop potato supply. No one can supply enough to match your previous supply and the Great International Potato Inflationary Crisis occurs. World leaders clamour for you to resume your supply, and you laugh maniacally from your potato funded spaceship. Hold the world to ransom as supplies of chips,  fries and crisps dwindle and die. Once sufficient panic has been created, get plastic surgery done and come back to Earth as the Potato Messiah, slowly bringing back potatoes to the world. The world is so grateful that they vote you World Leader. If they don't, cut off potato supply again. 

Edit: apparently I might face  invasion - potato funded private military for my sovereign space state of Potatica would be used to fend off attacks and burn down competing potato farms on Earth. I mean I'm not saying you'd want to destroy people's lives and incomes, but they really shouldn't be growing potatoes. 

Anyway, with near infinite potatoes, you have *infinite ammo*. With enough research and development we'd have potato bullets, potato armour, potato piercing rounds and potato cannonballs. Global military effort wouldn't stand a goddamn chance against the might of Potatica.

"[Obligatory Latvian joke]

1. Declare my project an ""emergency relief"" charity. Make up a silly set of terms for a national agreement: Government X will accept a zillion subsidized potatoes from me in exchange for cash money in a reserve currency.

2. Wait for famine or drought or migration crisis to hit some country. Approach them with the terms of step 1.

3. With the cash money from step 1, start building an bunker/headquarters in a safe location.

4. Expand the terms of the charity to promote pacifism and food security. In other words: I expand the terms of the subsidized potato program to include countries that have civil war or hunger. The terms of the deal are that the country has to surrender X many weapons in exchange for potatoes.

5. I start depositing the weapons at secure caches around the world.

6. I expand the terms of step 4 to include even any country: basically, you can hand over cash OR military hardware OR shut down an armament factory in exchange for a year's worth of subsidized potatoes.

7. I go to the rich, well-armed nations of the world (eg the USA, NATO, etc.) and offer a slightly modified version of step 4. That is, if they promise to donate or destroy major parts of their military hardware, I will promise to end world hunger by a certain date.

8. Acquire a nuke. Detonate it in the upper atmosphere over Europe. Enjoy pretty lights caused by the EMP.

9. Cancel the potato program due to the EMP effects. Watch as the world is plunged into hunger again. Start back-channeling guns and hardware to militants.

10. Partner with USA / NATO / CIA to sell guns &amp; potatoes to the world, with my organization as the ""emergency relief administrators"" who manage water, power, medicine, etc.  Restore each government to full economic &amp; military strength.  

11. Use fake evidence to reveal that USA / NATO / CIA detonated the nuke to take over the world.

Using an infinite supply of potatoes first you need to make a bit of money, so we sell them and buy up stocks of water, bottled. enough to last 1000 years.

Once the distillation is complete we sit back in our potato lair with our lovely fresh water supply and watch the world grovel to the feet of the potato god, and the rest of the world will be helpless to stop me since all the rest of the worlds water is pure 90% alcohol rendering them incapable of straight thought or driving safely.

"This might sound stupid, but... 

Turkeys. 

So I work at a golf course, and there are wild turkeys all over the place. No big deal, they're usually just in groups of 5-10, walking around and gobbling away. 

There are, as far as I know, 4 or maybe  groups of turkeys that wander the course, since it's a very large golf course. They usually remain in their individuals groups, scattered around the course. 

But one day, last year, something changed for a day. 

I can't explain why, but they decided to form one single massive group, centered around the group that hangs around the driving range. 

Now, I primarily work at the driving range, so I was able to see this firsthand. 

I'm at work, driving the picker cart (look it up if you don't know what that is), when, off in the distance, I hear something... 

""Gobble gobble gobble""

Then it gets louder, and I can hear more. An unusually large amount of gobbles are being uttered by what is usually a small clique of turkeys. 

Off in the distance, coming from the 10th hole, I see it. 

A mass of at least  turkeys running around, terrorizing golfers. 

The turkeys normally keep to themselves and run from people, but it seems that they found strength in numbers. People would just be in their cart as these turkeys would wander closed and closer to them. 

I saw one kid try to pet the turkeys, at which point the gobbles became aggressive. With a few flaps of their wings, they flew/hobbled over to this boy quickly, and angrily. I remember him screaming and his dad grabbing him, thankfully before it was too late. 

Soon enough, they came over to the driving range. I was unloading golf balls at the time, so I was not in the cart when I witnessed them approaching. 

I was honestly a bit nervous; what would I do if they attacked the range? I couldn't stop them. 

And that's when one brave and idiotic asshole of a 12 year old decided to try to impress his friends. 

""I bet you 5 bucks I can hit the turkeys"", the brave soul said to his short and chubby friend. 

""Bet you ten you can't"", chubbster said. 

And so this boy picked up his iron, placed down a ball, and ripped it 150 yards, straight into the turkeys. 

There was a storm of gobbles as the turkeys were hit. Panic arose within them; you could see they were visibly shaken. 

""Double or nothing."" chubbster muttered. 

And so the brave 12 year old took another ball, and proceeded to beautifully hit the ball and nail the turkeys. 

But this boy was ruthless. He wanted to see the turkeys hit as much as he could. 

He continued hitting golf balls at the turkeys, more accurately than I could ever imagine. It was beautiful, but horrifying. 

As the artillery of golf balls continued, the turkeys started to run in different directions, breaking apart from their supergroup. 

The boy did it. He saved us. He fought the turkeys and was victorious. 

Chubbster then angrily pulled out 20 dollars and gave it to this brave hero, and he certainly deserved it for his valiant efforts. 

That scare was only 35 turkeys. 

I can only imagine of it were nearly tripled. That boy was amazing, but I doubt he could hold off 100 turkeys.",2015-05-31 11:04:06,Ventuswag,436

"A dirty set of tableware in the kitchen.


Imagine being at somebody's home, and you go to the kitchen, to get something to eat or whatever.

Instead of finding the usual set of tableware in the bottom of the sink that means ""that guy ate stuff today"", you see a hundred of those. The guy just buys a new set everytime the old one is dirty, and dumps every used one into the kitchen. At the front it's just dirty, but you smell some moisture, some life is there inside, like a new horrible ecosystem was created in the kitchen, between all those pieces of tableware. Oddly enough, the kitchenware is shiny as new, but a little dusty.",2015-05-31 12:40:26,SomeTriggerPSA,21
