"Ross was not allowed to provide any defense.

Two of the lead DEA agents involved with this case have been indicted for skimming Bitcoins from Silk Road, and at least one of them took part in a fake ""hit man for hire"" scheme. The agent pretended to be a cocaine trafficker from some biker gang, and offered to kill up to 4 people who'd been threatening to dox Dread Pirate Rogers. On several occasions, hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins were transferred to the 'biker' for taking out these people threatening to dox DPR. There is no evidence that any murders actually took place, and the leading, logical theory is that the corrupt DEA agent(s) was(were) both the biker and the doxxers.

Again, Ulbricht's defense couldn't offer any of that as evidence. This stinks worse than the Justice Dept going after Aaron Swartz.

- Access to Sensitive Business Records: The PATRIOT Act gave the FBI nearly unlimited power to obtain business records, including sensitive files like medical, library and bookstore records, with a secret court order issued with no factual showing of need.

- Monitoring of Email and Web Surfing: The PATRIOT Act extended to the Internet the already broad authority to monitor transactional (non-content) information about communications with very little justification.

"My childhood friend has had a ""shady"" past to put it mildly. I'm still distant friends with him, but he has been through some shit, mostly from his own doing.. and drugs of course. 

In a heated text argument with one of his children's babies momma's, he texted her ""I'm going to shoot you"". 

Now it was clearly wrong what he did, he admits that, I admit that, everyone knows it was wrong. 

The recipient of that text took it to the police. The police arrested him and didn't charge him for assault, which essentially thats what it was. They instead chose to use the patriot act and charge him for terrorism. Instead of the typical slap on the wrist/community service/fine type thing, he was charged as a terrorist. 

He was sentenced to 6 months in jail, for texting that. 

Had he simply walked to her house and told her that, they couldn't have charged him as a terrorist. Thats the patriot act. 

Because he did 6 months, he lost his job, car, housing, lost nearly all his possessions because he couldn't pay for the storage facility. 

He also fell back on his child support payments and they began to doc his wages. Because his wages were doced so much, he couldn't pay for another place to live. Without a place to live he couldn't seek employment as what he was trained to do, electrician. You can't be part of the electricians union without a residence in his state. 

Eventually his backed child support payments landed him back in jail, which he has been in and out of ever since. 

All be cause he texted ""I'm going to shoot you"". 

Now I'm not defending his actions, neither is he, but this act which everyone seems think is keeping us safe, is in fact fucking up a lot of shit. It needs to go away.

The professors have to give TAMS tutors the exam as part of the program and therefore the tutors show the kids the exam. The TAMS kids all get the same grade on the exam. They also cheat during the test so you will hear the professors tell them to be quiet. No professors care at all, and if you confront administration about it they threaten expulsion for questioning their beloved TAMS program.

And when I say ""plagiarism,"" I mean examples as extreme as literally cut-n-pasting sections from Wikipedia articles into their essays without attribution, ripping off entire sections of books word for word, using essays they found online, very blatant, unmistakable academic crimes for which most of them never faced any consequence. I tried my best to get a few of the worst busted, to no avail. Note, this was a Canadian university, not US, and Canadians... well, we're a very ""polite"", very ""nice"" lot, and our Chinese visitors don't seem to mind taking every possible advantage of it, and many of us, apparently, are perfectly happy to let them... as long as they keep paying that massively inflated international student tuition.

&gt; # [Our Hidden History of Corporations in the United States](http://reclaimdemocracy.org/corporate-accountability-history-corporations-us/)

&gt;When American colonists declared independence from England in 1776, they also freed themselves from control by English corporations that extracted their wealth and dominated trade. After fighting a revolution to end this exploitation, our country’s founders retained a healthy fear of corporate power and wisely limited corporations exclusively to a business role. Corporations were forbidden from attempting to influence elections, public policy, and other realms of civic society.

&gt;Initially, the privilege of incorporation was granted selectively to enable activities that benefited the public, such as construction of roads or canals. Enabling shareholders to profit was seen as a means to that end. The states also imposed conditions (some of which remain on the books, though unused) like these*:

&gt;   * Corporate charters (licenses to exist) were granted for a limited time and could be revoked promptly for violating laws.
&gt;   * Corporations could engage only in activities necessary to fulfill their chartered purpose.
&gt;   * Corporations could not own stock in other corporations nor own any property that was not essential to fulfilling their chartered purpose.
&gt;   * Corporations were often terminated if they exceeded their authority or caused public harm.
&gt;   * Owners and managers were responsible for criminal acts committed on the job.
&gt;   * Corporations could not make any political or charitable contributions nor spend money to influence law-making.",2015-05-29 11:09:42,teary_ayed,33

**What you need to know:**

****

* **Magnitude:** 7.8 - Quite large. Average around 15 anually between 7 - 7.9.

* **Location:** 189km West Northwest of Chichi-shima, Japan. Far out to sea, shouldn't be any structural damage

* **Depth:** 677.6km - very deep. Shouldn't be much threat of a tsunami. The deeper, the ""safer""

* **Intensity of Shaking:** The USGS reports a shaking rating of V. Some people in Tokyo felt minor to moderate shaking, but nothing breathtaking.

* **Expected Fatalities:**



Expected Fatalities | Probability
-------------------|-----------
**No Deaths** | **99%**
1-10 | 1%
10-100 | 0%

* **Expected Costs of the Quake:**



Expected Cost (US$) | Probability
-------------------|-----------
**Under $1 million** | **99%**
Between $1-10m | 1%
Between $10-100m  | 0%

* **Tsunami:** No Tsunami has been generated by the quake.

"To reprise my /r/Japan comment...

To give you some scientific explanation hopefully distracting you from any stress. That earthquake was really unusual, because of its great depth it must have been along a Benioff zone. Which means its a piece of Oceanic crust that's been subducted and pushed all the way past the continental crust we're on and deep into the mantle (the more liquid part that the plates skim around on) but has remained solid despite the high temp and pressure.

It could be that a bit of that ocean floor which was erupted at the centre of the Pacific Ocean roughly in the Early Cretaceous (The age of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Triceratops and most of your other favourite dinosaurs (Yes it should have been called Cretaceous Park not Jurassic)) has just broken off from its long trawl across the planets surface to drift down through the mantle to rest in a lithospheric graveyard at the bottom of the mantle maybe to be slowly recycled into more mantle in the distant future.

We sat there for about 15 minutes until they started letting people on the elevator again. I have been visiting Tokyo this week and am amazed at how quickly everyone just goes back to normal. Once we reached the ground, you would have had no idea that there had been an earthquake based on how people were acting.

[The Top Five Special Interest Groups Lobbying To Keep Marijuana Illegal](http://www.republicreport.org/2012/marijuana-lobby-illegal/)

   1.) Police Unions: Police departments across the country have become dependent on federal drug war grants to finance their budget. In March, police union lobbyist in California coordinated the effort to defeat Prop 19, a ballot measure in 2010 to legalize marijuana, while helping his police department clients collect tens of millions in federal marijuana-eradication grants. And it’s not just in California. Federal lobbying disclosures show that other police union lobbyists have pushed for stiffer penalties for marijuana-related crimes nationwide.

2.) Private Prisons Corporations: Private prison corporations make millions by incarcerating people who have been imprisoned for drug crimes, including marijuana. Corrections Corporation of America, one of the largest for-profit prison companies, revealed in a regulatory filing that continuing the drug war is part in parcel to their business strategy. Prison companies have spent millions bankrolling pro-drug war politicians and have used secretive front groups, like the American Legislative Exchange Council, to pass harsh sentencing requirements for drug crimes.

 3.) Alcohol and Beer Companies: Fearing competition for the dollars Americans spend on leisure, alcohol and tobacco interests have lobbied to keep marijuana out of reach. For instance, the California Beer &amp; Beverage Distributors contributed campaign contributions to a committee set up to prevent marijuana from being legalized and taxed.

 4.) Pharmaceutical Corporations: Like the sin industries listed above, pharmaceutical interests would like to keep marijuana illegal so American don’t have the option of cheap medical alternatives to their products. Howard Wooldridge, a retired police officer who now lobbies the government to relax marijuana prohibition laws, told Republic Report that next to police unions, the “second biggest opponent on Capitol Hill is big PhRMA” because marijuana can replace “everything from Advil to Vicodin and other expensive pills.”

 5.) Prison Guard Unions: Prison guard unions have a vested interest in keeping people behind bars just like for-profit prison companies. In 2008, the California Correctional Peace Officers Association spent a whopping $1 million to defeat a measure that would have “reduced sentences and parole times for nonviolent drug offenders while emphasizing drug treatment over prison.”",2015-05-30 13:20:59,theseeds,61

When I left the Marine Corps the very first thing I did was go cold turkey on the opiates and started smoking. Since my state (NY) and the federal government doesn't believe in the right of the individual to chose what goes into his body, I've had to risk criminal charges for years to avoid killing my body with pain killers.

He is often suicidal and the different pharmaceuticals he's been prescribed over the years either made this worse or have been innefective.

In addition, va-patients who are being treated for chronic pain have generally been told they cannot use medical marijuana (even if legal in the state of residence and recommended by a private non-VA doc) because use of marijuana is considered to be incompatible with other pain medication use, such as opiates. Actual medical studies suggest otherwise, but that does not matter.

Just think, a lot of older people vote, and it's the general consensus that some of the veterans are older people (no offense if any is taken). If they apply for the medical Mary Jane plan, it might influence some minds. Idk, longshot and theorized, but could be a possible influential point made during the Senate meeting when the bill passed.

Cops deal with the most violent and depraved individuals in the country every day. How does it shock anyone that sometimes violent people get violent and then sometimes get shot.

- The vast majority of victims — more than 80 percent — were armed with potentially lethal objects, primarily guns, but also knives, machetes, revving vehicles and, in one case, a nail gun. (Could gun control be a problem? Hmm)  
- The OP article states that black people were disproportionately represented. The article OP posted cites^ 100 black people killed and 171 white people were killed. This comes off initially as alarming, when you see that the black population is about 13% with  the white population being around 78%.  
- The unfortunate statistic that follows is that race data for crime is collected and African-Americans make up for 50% of all violent crime in the US. This is going to make me sound brutally racist, but it's a true statistic and I learned it in university and just reconfirmed.  
Healing needs to be done in the black community in terms of better role models and representation on the OTHER SIDE of the criminal justice system. More money needs to be put into community initiatives in at-risk African-American communities to change the wild 50% violent crime statistic. I'm not here to excuse the amount of deaths, but at the same time, I feel there are real reasons why the number is so high and it's not a simple ""fuck the police, they kill everyone"".",2015-05-31 14:55:19,vigilantedinosaur,8
"What I find interesting is how little gun crime there is in my hometown.

The county has a population of 10,000. It's very conservative and rural. Hunting is a very popular sport. Given all of those and judging from the people I talk to, I would say at least 50% of households have a gun (really just guessing, but I'd love to see the numbers!)

I know the local law enforcement. They're not the brightest people in the world and probably not trained incredibly well either.

There might be 1 homicide every few years, but I never hear of an officer killing a person.

So maybe it's being in a large group that helps desensitize people. Before I moved out, I recognized almost everyone in my county. I knew all of my classmates in my grade level. I knew their families, where they all worked, where their families worked, and all that shit. Maybe this close relationship with the people makes us less likely to commit violent crimes.

Or maybe it's just easier for poor people to live out there. The cost of living is incredibly low. Just about anyone can afford a trailer and a plot of land and live in relative comfort back there. Plus you have more breathing room. None of this ""stuff as many people into a shitty apartment building as you can.""

He then seems to have decided, ""Either I'm killing you &amp; escaping or you're killing me &amp; I'm not going to prison."" He started pulling out his gun while repeatedly saying, ""I was in the military.""

"What a stupid ~~article~~ blog.

First, there is no link or bill number forcing me to use Google to find out what they are talking about.  But I cannot blame them since it is a bullshit ~~article~~ blog.

From them:

&gt;Specifically, the bill says that anyone who “enters onto open land for the purpose of collecting resource data” without the landowner’s permission can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. More specifically, the term “collect” is defined as acquiring or preserving any information, including photographs, “which is submitted or intended to be submitted to any agency of the state or federal government.”

&gt;But what is “open land?” Is it public as well as private land? If I am hiking on state land and discover an illegal toxic dump, and if I then photograph that dump and give a copy of the image to an “agency of the state,” could I be charged under this law? Maybe. What if I am observing birds for the Audubon Christmas Bird Count, and Audubon passes on that information for a government report on climate change? Will I be fined $1,000 for seeing and describing a red-breasted nuthatch? Maybe.

Now, a Google search turned up:

http://legisweb.state.wy.us/2015/bills/SF0012.pdf

&gt;A person is guilty of trespassing to unlawfully collect resource data if he:

&gt;Enters onto or crosses private open land for the purpose of collecting resource data

But wait, that is only if they do *not* have:

&gt;Statutory, contractual or other legal authorization to enter or cross the land to collect resource data

or

&gt;Written or verbal permission of the owner, lessee or agent of the owner to enter or cross the land to collect the specified resource data.
