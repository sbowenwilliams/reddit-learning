"OK so I see this question a lot, but I have found myself asking it. 

How do I deal with falcos lasers?
 
Pretty much on any map, I play Fox and whenever I'm on the ground from any distance (besides up close) I get caught in lasers I don't know how to effectively get around it. What I find myself doing is jumping over them which gives up my stage control and puts me in a bad situation to get hit. I've seen in the past that I should use the platforms to get around this. Should I implement the platforms more? Also what about on FD? 

Another thing to add is, the falco always stays at the edge and whenever he grabs me he throws me off the stage, shoots a laser to lower my recovery, then he dairs me when I attempt to get back on stage, this is how he usually takes 3/4 of my stocks. Any advice on how I can work on improving these things?",2015-05-29 08:24:34,bDuke_,6

Edit: not in regard to general game sense, but specific complex small interactions, like Marth doing late Fair on shield, and dashing past me to get behind me. I fell for it twice trying to grab the dude and got punished.",2015-05-29 02:40:59,GeZ_,1

"A couple weeks ago you may of seen the new [Shine&gt;Nair Platform Warp](http://gfycat.com/VerifiableAliveAchillestang) that was discovered by Kitsune91, and documented by myself. While that tech is good (especially if you want to combo from the shine), it is incredibly difficult to be consistent. I believe I have found an answer for that, with this new tech guaranteeing you a setup within a 4 frame window, and allows other aerials to be used. This does require you to hit something, like a Platform Cancel.

So to do this tech, you must first perform a backwards shorthop then doublejump on airborne frame 11 or later (seen windows below). From the double jump you must aerial on a specific DJ frame, see details below.
______________________________________________
**Yoshis top platform**

**NAIR**

4 frame window to DoubleJump (11-14) | frame perfect Nair (5th DJ frame)

1 frame gap with no setup (15)

2 extra frame window to DJ (16-17) | frame perfect Nair (6th DJ frame)

**BAIR**

4 frame window to DJ (11-14) | frame perfect Bair (5th DJ frame)

**DAIR**

4 frame window to DJ (11-14) | frame perfect Dair (4th DJ frame)

**FAIR**

4 frame window to DJ (11-14) | frame perfect Fair (3rd DJ frame)
_____________________________________________________
**Fountain of Dreams top plat**

**NAIR**

3 frame window to DJ (11-13) | 2 frame window to Nair (5-6th DJ frame)

Extra 3 frame window to DJ (14-16) | frame perfect Nair (6th DJ frame)

**BAIR**

3 frame window to DJ (11-13) | frame perfect Bair (5th DJ frame)

**DAIR**

3 frame window to DJ (11-13) | frame perfect Dair (4th DJ frame)

**FAIR**

3 frame window to DJ (11-13) | frame perfect Fair (3rd DJ frame)
2 frame gap with no setup
1 frame window to DJ (16) | frame perfect Fair (4th DJ frame)
________________________________________________________
Don't be scared by the frame perfect aerials, it is a very intuitive timing very similar to wavedashing and easy to be consistent at.

I am currently testing other stages and setups. It is not possible on Battlefield (except 1 double frame perfect nair setup from a backwards fullhop), but you can perform it from mid platform to top platform, havent fiddled around with it too much, but I found [this cool little trick](http://gfycat.com/FeminineGregariousHypsilophodon). It's a frame perfect DJ, but you can nair anytime, it doesn't require hitlag to work. It's kinda useless but it's kinda cool. If you were to hit something you would have to perform the nair at a specific time.

I am also positive other characters can use this tech as well, I tested Sheik a bit and she can do it with all aerials except dair ofc, fairly easily. Basically if they backflip from their backwards short hop then there is a high chance they have setups. Will edit if I find more.
__________________________________________________________

A good way to practice this is to use 20XX and set up the opponent on the top platform, then use the invincibility function (X + DpadUp) so that they don't fly away every time you hit them. It's a little easier on FoD, so you could try it there if you are having trouble.

_________________________________________________________

Other characters

**Fox** - frame data below

**Sheik** - all aerials except dair, easy

**Samus** - fair, upair, very easy (fullhop for hers)

**Ganon** - Nair, upair, easy (fullhop) (also has a NIL)",2015-05-29 08:04:28,schmooblidon,25
Cool shit.  I was convinced that platform warps would never be implemented in people's gameplay because of their inconsistency but this might be viable in some cases.  Like if they're sitting in shield on top platform and you react quick enough you could pull off a platform warp nair/dair/bair to shine grab or something.,2015-05-29 09:18:35,fuckreddit1234567890,15

"From a theorycrafting perspective, fox has only 2 weaknesses, his weight and fallspeed, fallspeed can also be a strength however (primarily in a better SHFFL), but these two values are mostly weaknesses across the set of possible situations during a match. To be specific, these two values are only really weaknesses when being comboed and tech-chased, or when hit with moves that have high base-knockback/knockback-growth and send at a primarily horizontal angle. 

Weight and fallspeed are technically a weakness when being edgeguarded, but I'll go into exactly why it doesn't affect fox very much.

He's lightweight, which means he takes more knockback from all moves than most any other characters (exceptons, pikachu, pichu, G&amp;W, jiggs, kirby), which also means he takes more hitstun.

He is also a fast faller, so all vertical knockback vectors are quickly reduced by gravity, meaning he actually moves a very small distance when knocked upwards. However as stated, he still takes more hitstun because he was still technically dealt more knockback.

This means that he is easier to juggle than any character in the game, being unable to act due to hitstun for a relatively long time, while remaining very close to his initial position where he took knockback allowing for followups.

Due to his low weight, all throws have very low endlag when used on him (the higher the weight of a character thrown the longer the throw animation will last), and any throw that has primarily vertical KB will cause lots of hitstun while not sending him very far away, perfect for regrabs.

This means that up-throw chaingrabs are uniquely effective on fox. Tech chasing is also very effective since the opponent will be able to act out of throws very quickly and position themselves optimally for reacting to his tech/getup option select.

Offstage, while he does have a great recovery, he will still receive greater KB and hitstun from any move landed upon him than most characters, and due to his fall speed gravity will pull him down a greater distance for each frame he is in hitstun than most characters. This means that landing any attack on him offstage has higher reward (disregarding his recovery, more on that in a bit) than on any other character.

All taken into account, he is perhaps the weakest character in the game when being comboed and tech chased. However he is undeniably the best character in the game in neutral, and his firefox has a very small disambiguation window and can go almost any direction while having a large range and comboing into Uair on hit (sakurai combo). 

To clarify, the disambiguation window is how long you have to react to an opponent's option select (to visually determine what they are doing) before they have returned to a neutral state (usually standing) in which case the match has reset to neutral (unless you yourself are offstage) and you have dropped the combo/tech-chase/edgeguard. 

If a disambiguation window is very large (greater than half a second, 30 frames) most characters can followup ""on reaction"", however if a disambiguation window is small (under a quarter of a second, 15 frames) you followup ""on a read"", where you simply guess what the opponent will chose to do and begin to cover that option before they themselves have even made the decision.

Fox's firefox travels quite fast and the startup has no visual cue that assists you, ergo you almost always have to cover it on a read. However his position offstage can limit his available options so you don't have to cover all possible angles, but it is very difficult to edgeguard in most positions, and nearly impossible to edgeguard on reaction in most situations (which is why the mangle is so good sometimes, if you get that reference).

Disambiguation windows are really important for edgeguarding characters, captain falcon's recovery has a very large disambiguation window and is therefore incredibly simple to edgeguard, marth's has a very low disambiguation window (dolphin slash has almost no startup before he begins to move) but has few possible paths of travel and therefore can often be covered in entirety by a single edgeguarding option (though it's still a read as to when he uses it). Even though fox's weight/fall-speed are very bad in the context of the melee physics engine (bad when comboed, good in neutral), his recovery is so good that it compensates his recovery prowess.",2015-05-30 15:15:25,Daftatt,61
His only real weakness is how combo-able he is. The rest of them vary from player to player and you have to identify what they are on an individual basis. Otherwise just practice your punish game on him a ton.,2015-05-30 14:56:21,Yrale,13
He doesn't have much range on his moves.,2015-05-30 14:38:29,Sycorax83,5
"He get's comboed easily, he's really light, he's easy to gimp, and he has low range compared to the other top tiers.

With that being said, in Melee you're usually better off focusing on your character's strengths, instead of the opponent's weaknesses.",2015-05-30 16:15:00,RathKeno,1
"To paraphrase someone better than me: Fox has many weaknesses. Some of these are the properties of his attacks. Fox has weak damage output a lot of the time and his close range attacks have vulnerabilities to certain defenses. His attacks are low range, after attacks fox will need to move to avoid retaliation whereas other characters don't need to because of their long range.

Fox has a low knockdown weight and combo physics. This means he gets punished for small mistakes harder than most characters.

When you combine these flaws, you get a character that can get counter-attacked and death combo'd for landing an attack.  This becomes more relevant when you develop your SDI habits and awareness. 

One of foxes main tools against crouch-cancelling is his dair, which is weak to SDI -&gt; punish. His grab-&gt; up throw conversion can also deal with cc, but it doesn't work with consistency against some characters. Fox is awesome, but you there are ways to mess with him.",2015-05-30 16:45:44,thetallest,1
"Aside from what Daftatt said, fox lacks disjoint and almost all of his approaches can be stuffed(with the exception of bair in some matchups). Take advantage of this by abusing stage control. Corner him so that he cant avoid attacks with dashedancess and punish him when he shields or jumps. He is also pretty easy to edgeguard. His up b has 42 frames of startup and his side b has 21 frames of startup. If you play falco you can laser him when he is recovering until he has to use up b to recover from below. At this point his recovery is predictable and you only have to cover 1 or 2 options.",2015-05-30 19:55:06,-Nazca,1
"Well the big one is that he's a fast faller, he's very comboable as a result. He's also quite gimpable if you get a read on his recovery. Also a lot of characters have tech chase setups/chain grabs on him. He's a really good character without a ton of weaknesses so IMO the best way to handle him is to know how to bait common fox approaches like nair and running shine, and punish them as hard as possible.",2015-05-30 14:17:56,Choft,1

As for making a scene/TOing, make sure you have a set venue that you can schedule events regularly. If you attend a university, you can make a club and start a scene at your school and attract a new crowd. The school will most likely also be able to supply you with a venue that you can rent out.

So I did some testing and found that the diagonal notch is like the limit of angled...ness. But his up-b is super sensitive to DI so your controller might not let you have it snug in the notch, might need to have it a tiny bit higher. (Just test if you can land on the plat using the notch)

Neither of the setups are 100% reliable, but the diagonal is about 70% consistent from run/dash. But as long as you do it earlier rather than later then it isn't the end of the world.

On Yoshi's Story, Mario and Doc's grounded up-b can just reach the top platform if angled correctly (their grounded SJP's have the same distance). The Up-B angle needs to be straight upwards, as a forward trajectory will not reach high enough to reach the platform, though I'm unsure about any of the ordinal angles though. If he manages to hit the very edge of the platform, it will cancel all the landing lag of the up-b and can act immediately.  I'm almost positive this is a true combo, but more testing will need to be done. 

Going frame by frame in debug however, has proven that this may be an inconsistent trick.

"Best read in terms of hype/excitement/etcxd -&gt; Mango puff v armada genisis, or fox vs hbox evo

Best moment goes to Lord vs S2J IMO. But that wasn't anywhere near optimization and what not, and it was an exhibition match so I feel like that's cheating LOL xD

Punish is soooo debatable since literally there have been countless 0-deaths from punishes in high level play (Though my fav is Hax Falcon on FD ""WATCH THE BUTTON!!!!!!!"") and also from coast to coast combo heheeheh

Capitalization, not sure what you mean by this. Since it'd seem the same as punish, though only other way is to use Randall or a pokemon stadium change. In that case for randall I always loved mangos charged upsmash v armada as he slowly floats down to his demise lmao

also I notice Mango is in a shit load of these comparatively LOL",2015-05-31 03:20:29,danielvutran,-1
If said player chooses options that we know does not work and there is an option that abuses a certain characteristic of the character but he does not choose it. These sorts of things would not happen if the player knew what to do. The types of things like doing unsafe shield pressure to samus or not doing a super easy way to edge guard characters. If someone does not know a matchup you can sometimes tell also that they are playing scared.,2015-05-31 12:17:56,THEEBIGT,9
"The moon didn't kill until after 150 each stock, failed to edgeguard until the end of the set, etc. 

That's not to say saus wasn't making good reads in neutral, comboing well, etc. but they seemed to be going even in neutral but saus was living longer to damage and widen the life gap between them.",2015-05-31 14:48:20,krispness,4

"i suppose that's just it: analysis. you've got to be able to understand various attributes of both chars to be able to decide what caused the outcome of a given match, as well as the skill of the player. i think really often, it's a combination of relative matchup unfamiliarity and strong play from the mid/low tier. i say relative because the community as a whole knows more about fox than it may know about samus. i also think it's fairly reasonable to assume that while the top players will (and should) have matchup knowledge for the whole cast, their knowledge of the more uncommon characters will be obviously less comprehensive. 

i think there are a few signs that somebody's been outplayed by a low tier. leffen should (and i expect does) know that samus's grab is really slow (i think it's 20 frames or something), but hugs was grabbing him regularly during their set at press start. knowing about samus's grab is basic matchup knowledge, as anyone can play against a samus and notice that her grab takes a long time. despite this, leffen was, as i said, getting grabbed often, which tells us that hugs was able to put leffen in situations where he couldn't avoid or predict it.",2015-05-31 14:08:08,bam33,1

"I did something like this this year. Start a ""Smash Club"", where people can learn to play and play matches at lunch or after school.  Try to get posters up around the school to advertise it. It depends on how many people you get there, but make sure you have enough setups. Waiting 10 minutes for a turn is no fun, though doubles gets a lot of people playing. If you can get a teacher involved to help with finding a room to play in and to help with setting up a tournament. Have some extra controllers around for newcomers who don't have one with them. Teach everyone how to setup a game (amount of stocks and time limit, friendly fire). Teach everyone how tournament matches work, stage striking and selection, the legal stages and whatnot. But also try not to make it too serious at first because it might scare people off maybe. 

Good luck!",2015-05-31 18:34:19,vBloodbuzz,2
