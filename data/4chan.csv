"It's always been difficult for me to listen to people giving advice or motivational speeches like this when they're living at the top due to a lot of luck. I've always liked Shia LaBeouf as an actor and he seems like a very genuine person during interviews; he came from a poor family, worked very hard, made a name for himself, but at the same time won the Hollywood lottery as far as an actor. I'm not trying to subtract anything from him or his talent, he's a fine entertainer, but when a person (especially as young as he was/is) achieves that position of tremendous wealth and blockbuster fame, it's easy to forget the amount of blind chance and good fortune that's playing a major hand in your accomplishments.

There are actors, musicians, stand-up comedians, entertainers of all kinds who are much more ambitious and talented that struggle their entire lives without a fraction of the success Shia LaBeouf has achieved. It's not that they're lacking effort, it's just that the mainstream entertainment industry is completely sealed off to outsiders with the exception of a small few. Most leading actors (and even character actors, shit - even stuntmen) are born into the Hollywood lifestyle. Their parents or grandparents or brother or sister or uncle was established somehow in the industry, cementing a place for themselves and their family in that field. Shia didn't have this luxury, he started as a child actor doing television spots and worked his way up, but again, a lot of actors start here...and end here as well. If you're an inch too short, or ten pounds too heavy, or have the wrong color eyes, or flub a few lines at any particular moment it could cost you a crucial part in an upcoming commercial or cancel out a brief cameo appearance on a sitcom or even lose you that bit-part in a major motion picture. That's all it takes sometimes to get thrown to the Tinseltown wayside, so you better have a lot of luck on your side, and as fate would have it...Shia did.

He was/is young, ambitious, talented and very, very lucky to have gained such a tremendous amount of success in the Hollywood spotlight - and I think that success can sometimes blind a person to the latter. No one wants to believe they have no real control over things, especially their own life, destiny and personal achievements, because if luck was the deciding factor in all that, then what have they really accomplished? It's realizations like that, that can leave a person second guessing themselves, and I think people would much rather err on the side of comforting lies rather than harsh truths. It's human nature, and it keeps them moving forward.

Obviously my life-perspective is a little more pessimistic, but a lot more realistic. Work hard, follow your dreams, set goals, and achieve what you can, but don't forget there's a planet full of people out there who are doing the exact same thing (in fact some are trying their damnedest to stop you), and for every one that makes it there's five-thousand that don't. So stay strong, keep your mind sharp, and stay on your path. May luck find you on your way.

TLDR: Shia is cool. God bless his heart. His talent and ambition took him far, but he's also very lucky.",2015-05-30 17:16:29,Combo_Breaker01,1

"It's always been difficult for me to listen to people giving advice or motivational speeches like this when they're living at the top due to a lot of luck.  I've always liked Shia LaBeouf as an actor and he seems like a very genuine person during interviews; he came from a poor family, worked very hard, made a name for himself, but at the same time won the Hollywood lottery as far as an actor.  I'm not trying to subtract anything from him or his talent, he's a fine entertainer, but when a person (especially as young as he was/is) achieves that position of tremendous wealth and blockbuster fame, it's easy to forget the amount of blind chance and good fortune that's playing a major hand in your accomplishments.

There are actors, musicians, stand-up comedians, entertainers of all kinds who are much more ambitious and talented that struggle their entire lives without a fraction of the success Shia LaBeouf has achieved.  It's not that they're lacking effort, it's just that the mainstream entertainment industry is completely sealed off to outsiders with the exception of a small few.  Most leading actors (and even character actors, shit - even stuntmen) are born into the Hollywood lifestyle.  Their parents or grandparents or brother or sister or uncle was established somehow in the industry, cementing a place for themselves and their family in that field.  Shia didn't have this luxury, he started as a child actor doing television spots and worked his way up, but again, a lot of actors start here...and end here as well.  If you're an inch too short, or ten pounds too heavy, or have the wrong color eyes, or flub a few lines at any particular moment it could cost you a crucial part in an upcoming commercial or cancel out a brief cameo appearance on a sitcom or even lose you that bit-part in a major motion picture.  That's all it takes sometimes to get thrown to the Tinseltown wayside, so you better have a lot of luck on your side, and as fate would have it...Shia did.

He was/is young, ambitious, talented and very, very lucky to have gained such a tremendous amount of success in the Hollywood spotlight - and I think that success can sometimes blind a person to the latter.  No one wants to believe they have no real control over things, especially their own life, destiny and personal achievements, because if luck was the deciding factor in all that, then what have they really accomplished?  It's realizations like that, that can leave a person second guessing themselves, and I think people would much rather err on the side of comforting lies rather than harsh truths.  It's human nature, and it keeps them moving forward.

Obviously my life-perspective is a little more pessimistic, but a lot more realistic.  Work hard, follow your dreams, set goals, and achieve what you can, but don't forget there's a planet full of people out there who are doing the exact same thing (in fact some are trying their damnedest to stop you), and for every one that makes it there's five-thousand that don't.  So stay strong, keep your mind sharp, and stay on your path.  May luck find you on your way.


**TLDR:**  Shia is cool.  God bless his heart. His talent and ambition took him far, but he's also *very* lucky.",2015-05-30 10:42:00,BryanWake,1

Suddenly, another man, naked, walks into the kitchen and begins to receive a blowjob from the corporal's wife. As he is beginning to climax, she directs the resultant semen into the mixing bowl.
