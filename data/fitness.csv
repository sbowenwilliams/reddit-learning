"Hi Alan!

I've been a lurker here at /r/fitness, and saw your videos.  You're really great to watch, and enthusiastic which bleeds over wire.

For a while now, I've been changing the way I eat, and I've lost over 70 pounds since the beginning just from diet change alone.  I now have been looking for a bodyweight program that maybe you can suggest for someone who hasn't done much exercise in over 10 years.

I look for a lot of sets but I was hoping to have someone that really knows what they're doing (and live here, of course) to maybe put me in the right direction--starting-wise.

I'm female, if this changes anything.  I'm really looking to increase upper body strength (I have none), and tone the lower half of my body.  I don't have access to a gym (Vermont middle of nowhere) hence resorting to bodyweight.  I do have a set of 5 pound dumbbells, and a pull-up bar that I can wedge on a door frame... but way too weak for lifting still.

Overall, what kind of schedule would you suggest?  If you need any other information, please let me know.  Again, I appreciate your AMA, and glad you are doing yet another!",2015-05-29 09:54:03,jetillian,10

"Hey Alan, love your how-to vids, and had a question regarding the deadlift one. How much of the beginning of a Deadlift should be done with your legs?

This is the one lift that still badgers me, and I've had trainers watch my form and everything. I did it two different ways with two different trainers and they both said it looked good so I'm dumbfounded.

Been having a hard time keeping the back straight throughout as I get to my working weight (@250lbs, I'm 5'10 and 160lbs). I've recently found maybe this works, but I'm worried I'm doing more of a ""reverse squat"" sort of thing. 

I start with the ""loosen the slack"" in the arms, and approach it like you advise with being ready to fire - then bring my butt down and keep the back straight, chest up, but right at the beginning I basically am using what feels like pure leg drive to get the bar to my knees, directing all the pressure to go through the heels.

I've heard of using leg drive before, but never really was sure what it meant. This has allowed me to keep everything locked up and take pressure off my lower back. Once at the knees, I transfer the direction and fire my hips to hump the bar. Does that sound right?",2015-05-29 10:23:53,6stringNate,3

"Former physical therapy aide here. You can do something we call a ""pelvic tilt"" to help this. If you know much about anatomy, your hips can tilt, usually either posteriorly (back) or anteriorly (front). Tilting your hips posteriorly will help. To best understand what I mean, lay flat on a stiff surface, like the floor, and bend your knees so that your feet are on the floor, shoulder width, and legs are roughly 90 degrees. At this point, you can slide your hand under your lower back. Tighten your core and tilt your hips like you're pulling them up to your ribs, which will press your lower back into your hand. This is a posterior tilt. If you do this while standing, you will have better posture and will see the ""resting gut"" decrease, but it may not disappear completely.

The rest of it is probably just some body fat.",2015-05-29 03:31:02,JangaJam,30

"Whenever you grow abdominal muscle, your stomach gets larger. Even If you have large abs and extremely low body fat when you are relaxed your stomach is going to have ""resting gut"" even more so than a person with small abs at a similar body fat percentage.

Your abdominal cavity is full of your internal organs and intestines that exert pressure on your abdominal area due to gravity and push your stomach out when their isn't resistance. That's why you may notice you have worse ""resting gut"" whenever you have just had a big meal.

Don't worry about it man! It's completely normal.

There are 2 ways you can make having this better. I've trained myself to always hold my stomach in a little bit, the same way you  teach yourself to hold your back straight for good posture. Eventually it becomes automatic.

The other option is to do vacuums, this trains the transverse abdominis. The stronger this muscle is the tighter your gut will be held in at a resting state, and the harder your will be able to suck in your stomach.",2015-05-29 01:19:17,aaronis1,78
"Everyone is saying core, vacuum, posture. I think all this will help but I think the real issue is your body fat. You're at a normal healthy % prolly lower teens or so. You want them abs to show up while resting you'll have to drop below 10%. The depth of your belly button indicates that you still have a thin layer of fat wrapped around your waist like a corset.

"An issue that I haven't seen mentioned here is visceral fat vs. subcutaneous fat. People tend to think of fat as all being right under your skin, padding the outside of your body, but there is also fat which accumulates around your internal organs or ""viscera.""

I seem to have trouble with this because I appear skinny and have very little fat between my skin and abdominal muscles, but I still have a ""gut"" that sticks out when I relax. I think that part of my problem is APT which has been mentioned a lot in this thread, but I still have a rounded gut that sticks out when I relax and no amount of posture change is going to make it completely flat. 

Aside from looking bad, high visceral abdominal fat is also concerning because it's correlated with increased risk for heart disease. From what I can tell there's no specific way to fight it, only fat reduction through exercising more and reducing caloric intake. I also read one article finding that high abdominal fat is associated with binge drinking (consuming a large number of drinks in a short amount of time.)

"A lot of people are trying to give fancy fixes for this but...

Honestly, to an extent this is extremely normal. Your abdominal wall takes up space, and as your abs get bigger, they're going to push out further unless you're actively contracting them.

Combine this with the fact that, unless you're constantly starving yourself, you will normally have a food bolus in your stomach contributing to the effect, this is not abnormal. 

I think our expectations are distorted from pictures of people flexing their abs to perfection for photoshoots and celebrities that suck in their guts all the time.

Work your ~~intercostal~~ [transverse?]  abs with stomach vacuums and planks. They keep your core tight and tucked.

REASON WHY! Pelvic Angle is corrupted by our shoes, our heels aren't supposed to be supported by raising them off the ground. I hope this fucking helps.",2015-05-29 12:34:25,MrStiglitz,3
"IIRC it has a couple of key components to it. I, a long time beer-gut sufferer, had a similar issue. Core strength, both front abs, and lower back, help to pull in your gut while resting, but along with that comes posture, because no amount of muscle can make you have good posture. Dieting does considerably help since the fat that is causing the issue is the outer fat, which can be burned off, and avoided by eating more fruits and veggies. I recommend having a fresh smoothie to start your day. It's easy, you can get in both fruit and veggies, and you'll see the resting gut disappear (almost all the way)",2015-05-29 02:46:10,SitNshitN,1

I'm afraid ""resting gut"" is a factor of body fat %.  Unless you're down very close to or at single digit BF%, you're not likely going to see your abs without flexing.

"I was reading through responses here when I discovered APT. Holy crap, my life has been changed! Even after looking into posture and attempting to fix some minor issues I have, this problem somehow flew below the radar. I have the same ""gut"" and have always wondered why.

I just took the time to correct my posture by pulling my hips forward with my abs (just my abs, not by engaging my back and arching), and the feeling is bizarre. It feels good but difficult, like an exercise. I started walking around trying to maintain this hip position and damn, what have I been doing to myself all of these years?!

The feeling of correct posture is nice. It's almost like you are resting on yourself, which eliminates a lot of stress on your legs and hips. I find that my entire body feels a lot more comfortable and can ""let go"" a bit when I correct my APT. For now, my abs are under some stress when I do because they aren't used to it, but the rest of my body is affirming that this is indeed a great idea.

"Here's another piece of information about 'resting gut': much of 'proper breathing' teaches that big belly breaths are encouraged, and having gut extend (especially on the in-breath) is how it *should* look. It's a common problem/challenge for careers that need to utilize deep breathing -- my experience is as an actor/singer, but dancers, public speakers, teachers, and other presentational careers run into this.

Think about your classic image of an opera singer. They are barrel chested and large torso-ed for a reason-- they need excellent breath control!

It becomes a personal decision to create whichever effect you like, but analyzing breathing is super-helpful for just about anything.

As a kid it took me a while - I liked soccer and basketball, hated baseball (my eye-hand coordination was terrible), but really found my niche in track/cross country.  I also came to realize the only reason I seemed good at soccer was that I was faster than most of the kids on the field, my ball control was still fairly shitty, but I could outsprint a defender and cross the ball so the guy who was actually accurate could take the shot.

Encourage them to play outside when they're younger - tag, manhunt, riding bikes, catch, the works.  That builds up the coordination, etc that they'll need when they actually start in sports.

2yo runs around copying mum and dad when he sees us doing our routines. He flips the hell out if you take ""his"" ab wheel.

We have bench/powerrack in the garage, all of the kids do some level of lifting on that a couple of times a week. I've always lifted, their mum got into it recently so they just see it as something they should be doing.

All of the above is optional and is because the kids asked to get involved. My youngest boy just interrupted me typing this to ask when we'll be lifting weights tonight. We had to limit kids to a max of two clubs each as it's impossible to manage the transport otherwise.

Food is the only non-optional, you eat what's on your plate and you're given an age appropriate portion. The result of not eating dinner is you get no treats/dessert, no excuses no exceptions.

"my parents did jack shit. they didn't let me go to school and i'm an only child so i had nobody to play outside with. they only had shitty diet food in the house (i've known what Atkins is since i was literally 5 years old) so as a result whenever i was exposed to anything with carbs in it or anything that tasted good i wouldn't stop eating. 

naturally, with a totally abnormal view of food and no exercise, i got fat when i was 7, and trying out the local kids' swim team was a brutal awakening- i was bullied mercilessly, which just made me hate exercise more and eat more. by the time i was 11, my dad had jumped on the bandwagon of bullying me and my grandmother was chiding me for trying to eat a whole banana. 

the only reason i started losing weight was that I began to actually leave the house for school and be exposed to kids my age. i ran track because i knew i needed to lose weight, and while everyone still bullied me, it wasn't as bad as it was when i was younger. 

by the time I was 14, i was at a healthy weight and i'd been diagnosed with ADD, anxiety, and depression, and put on stimulants, which took a ton more weight off of me and the rapid weight loss gave me a taste for starving myself. 

i finally had the confidence to start dance late in life, but that's also been pretty terrible for body image issues. my freshman year of college i was eating 800 calories a day my first semester. if i hadn't gotten seriously ill and had the doctor convince me that i needed to start eating again, i don't know what would have happened. 

i'm now going into fitness and dance as a career, and i haven't been over a healthy BMI since I was a preteen, but i struggle, and I am known to have full emotional and mental breakdowns when the scale hits certain numbers, even numbers that are totally fine for my height. 

i'm proud that i can still fit into jeans i wore in high school and i'm proud that i didn't get fat in college, but i wish that i'd never had the problems in the first place. i wish that someone had taken me outside just to play and have fun when i was a kid instead of keeping me inside like a mushroom and then yelling at me for being chubby and sedentary. 

teach your kids how to move. nobody ever taught me how to move-even if they don't pick it up right away, or seem scared, just give it time. help them develop neuromuscular coordination, even if it's tedious for you. make it fun. make them food that's healthy and tastes good. don't put them on the same restrictive diets you're on. don't set them up for failure and bully them for failing.",2015-05-29 11:47:50,RuthStPenis,3

Just as his father and I have physical activities we do, all the time, as part of our lives.

"My parents had 4 boys so for our fitness they just let us play outside all damn day. All those badminton gains.

I have my 4 y/o son busy with me all the time. If I'm cleaning the kitchen he is on the step stool with a sponge 'helping' out too. He helps with his eggs and bacon. He helps hand me dishes from the dish washer. All this seems like it won't make a big difference but compare to him **watching tv while I do all this stuff.**

During the summer we walk to the pond in our neighborhood every couple of days, or go for a bike ride. Every off day has a trip to a park. We walk to check the mail- i don't stop off in my car on the way to fro.

I practice progressive feeding with him. He gets the healthy food first, then it progressively gets worse. So, eggs (coconut oil and cheese) first. Then bacon, then he can have the berries/or banana (fruit is gods candy. If he eats the fruit he won't eat his eggs). Then if he's eaten all this he can have some 90% cocoa for a snack.

The mother is big on sharing sweets and candy as a sign of affection. Which is fine. She can do that from her mothers house while I don't keep any of it in my home. She over candies him and I under candy him, for for a two week cycle he is probably getting the indulgence that is normal for a kid.",2015-05-29 11:01:27,TheThingsIThink,2

"My daughters are very young(Just turned 2, and 4 months) but we're already trying to work on these things.  Eating healthier choices, we don't drink anything but water or tea in the house, though of course my daughters drink milk.  Just no soda and what not.

In terms of activity, we just try to do things that are physical and fun.  We go to the park or zoo and walk/play.  We go outside and walk our neighborhood.  We have backyard toys and we run around and chase each other and play.

My 2 year old will mimic stretches I'm doing as well.  Kids(when they're young anyway) love to emulate their parents, so we'll just keep setting a good example.  I plan to teach them from a young age that being overweight is bad for your health and that it's important to stay active and eat relatively healthy.

To your 2nd point, unfortunately my parents had my sister and I when they were young, and neither one of them was much of an example in terms of diet or exercise for most of my life.  My sister and I both stayed very active in sports or just running around the neighborhood, so we both stayed thin through school, but both gained weight after high school when we stopped being active by default.  My sister is now quite obese, and I was overweight before I decided to just take control and get fit.

I will credit my Dad with the fact that when I was in my late teens he bought a treadmill and built a little home gym, started working out like crazy and eating better and lost a ton of weight.  He went from probably a size 40 waist to 32 and was in the best shape he'd been in since I was born.  It showed me that there are no excuses and anybody can make that change.  Unfortunately he tore up his knee at work, lost his job, ended up depressed, and by the time he came through it he had gained back all the weight, and now spends all his time not working basically playing caretaker to my obese mother so he doesn't get active.  It also doesn't help that he's on the path to getting a diagnosis of MS and is dealing with those symptoms.",2015-05-29 11:31:41,Derp_Stevenson,2

"When I was young my mum used to limit the amount of sugar I ate. Never any soda in the house, never any snacks or sweets. Meals were always cooked and had a tonne of veg in them.

I played sports, Gaelic football then rugby in school. I was brought to swimming lessons all the time and then swimming on a Saturday.

I grew up in the 90's so there was never really any computer games or satellite TV to keep me indoors, I was always outside playing with the neighbours and exploring (I lived in the country side).

Mum used to be an athlete, high jump, so I was encouraged to go to the athletics club and compete. Not just take part, compete. That lead me to work hard and train to win and take responsibility for my own performance. That ethic has followed me to adult life and everything I do in work I do to the best of my ability and always try and improve.

"As parents:
*Our kids are part of our weekend routine of hitting the gym both Saturday and Sunday morning - they go to the in-gym childcare center, which overlooks the weight floor. Occasionally we catch them mirin but mostly they just love hanging out there for an hour or 90 minutes while we work out.

*My 4-year-old daughter just started pretend-lifting - she'll squat, do a deadlift (without lifting anything) and lay flat with something like a plastic baseball bat in her hands to do a bench press! It's really cute - she has solid form and talks about how strong she is. 

*Soda is absolutely off-limits to them and interestingly, this doesn't make them want it - they have zero interest. We drink it occasionally but all drink water a lot more. Juice and milk are essentially considered special fluid options. Once or twice they've sipped seltzer and seem to find the bubbles uncomfortable. 

*For my older child, aged 7, he is consistently involved in some type of physical extra-curricular - it was martial arts 2x/week and now he has joined a cross-country team that meet 3x/week (in place of the karate). Starting in the fall the younger one will be doing her first team sport as well. 

*Both play outside every single day except for in really bad weather.

*We try to have physical activity be part of our fun / recreation time - neighborhood walks and bike rides, for example. 

*TV and screen time is limited to 1-1.5 hours per day (only at 6:30pm until bedtime which is between 7:30 and 8).

*My husband and I consciously avoid talking about dieting, our weight, and the words ""fat"", ""thin"", etc. We talk about working out but not about trying to get thinner.

Looking back, neither of my parents were very into fitness. My mom never worked out at all that I can remember, and coming into adulthood it was not a part of my life either, though I did sports in high school and through that stayed reasonably fit. She was big into dieting, though, and I have many memories relating to her being upset with her weight or looks, of her commenting and noticing others' weight and looks. These days she is extremely supportive and complimentary of me and how hard I work.

I teach them that eating too much (even healthy food) makes you go fat, and eating too little makes you weak.  Candy treats are fine, but only on Saturdays after dinner, or on special occasions.  The less treats we eat, the better they taste.

I provide fruit and veggie snacks in a bowl in the kitchen.  Usually they don't touch them, but they can see that I do.  Sometimes they try it.

I serve a fruit and vegetable with every meal-even breakfast. (The breakfast vegetable is usually pumpkin ""pie"" made with no sugar or crust). I don't care if he eats it, although he usually does, I just want him to get used to the idea that a meal should include a fruit and vegetable.

Whole grain bread and crackers instead of processed

Water and milk to drink only. If he asks for juice I'll give it to him but he rarely ever does. He only sees me drinking water and I got him a water bottle just like mine. He is in a big mimicing stage so drinking water out of matching water bottles is a big deal for him.

We share an afternoon snack together every afternoon, which is fruit and cheese with whole grain crackers. 

I make him vape instead of smoking cigarettes.

We spend a lot of time outside. According to my pedometer I'm averaging about 15000 steps a day so we are doing a lot of running around. 

When he gets older I intend to talk to him about exercise in terms of it making his body strong, instead of focusing on weight or looks.

Three of the four have caught the bug in their own way. The oldest (F) is really into walking. The second, (F) is interested in a mix of biking, walking and some weight lifting. One other (M) was self-professed anti-exercise and then this past year he got into doing push-ups because school goal setting had a physical goal required. Over a few months that just kept progressing till he hit 100 push-ups. At that point he wanted to get into weight lifting and over the past three months has made really steady gains in strength and developing a more muscular build. Now he is interested in boxing.

"For me I think the two most important things are:

1. Developing longterm habits
2. Social/role model aspects.

---1. For longterm habits, my parents were always so busy and didn't know how to fit in cooking because their job schedules were so odd. So I ate fast food multiple times a week - 29c cheeseburger Sundays, 19c hamburger Tuesdays anyone? &gt;.&lt; I was lucky I did so much activity that up until college (where there aren't a whole lot of easy, mandated get your body moving kind of things. Why would they get rid of P.E.???) I had a fast enough metabolism that I didn't really gain weight even with venti frappuccinos and fast food lunches galore. 

Starting late is harder, but definitely not impossible though. Reddits, blogs, and websites have been amazing for finding easy to make, healthy recipes, and I've been slowly fixing up my diet. It takes a long time to form the habits, but I'm really hoping they'll become second nature sometime!!

---2. One thing my parents really excelled in was encouraging the social aspects of exercise and being good exercise role models (my dad at least). When I was a kid, we'd go camping for family vacations to see a lot of different National Parks and try outdoor activities (I still remember the one time we white water rafted!). Especially now that I'm on a tight budget, I'm grateful that I like camping rather than hate it =).

And as a kid, I really wanted to fit in, so I did whatever my friends did. I know it's really hard/almost impossible for you to choose your friends, but I was lucky I did all kinds of dance, played sports during recess, joined dive/dancing teams in high school, all pretty much because my friends did it. 

I also don't know if I can recommend dance or gymnastics enough, even if you only take a year or so as a kid, because getting body awareness early on has helped me in so many ways. When I look around in fitness classes sometimes, I can tell I'm having an easier time than some in figuring out what my body's doing/where it's going/tracking knees over toes, etc., or being able to figure out the beat/choreo quickly so I can really try to push myself with each move rather than second guess myself. When I was doing dive, I could only wish I'd done gymnastics to have that upside-down awareness! So freaky xD

Right now as an adult (wuuuuut), the hardest part has been pairing both the habits and social aspects so I can hopefully get to where I want. The habits are hard (ice cream!!!), but I have a few people I work out with regularly, so I never want to flake on them and that's really helped =).",2015-05-29 14:26:06,bujeeboo,2
I keep ours in kids sports such as soccer and swimming. However I believe developing healthy eating habits is key for the long term.

"My son's only 6 months old, but I've been making changes already. I cook everything we eat, almost nothing comes out of a box, and we hardly ever indulge in junk food. When he starts solids, it'll be homemade veggie puree. I've taken up lifting, running, and hope to join a casual volleyball team once our schedule is a bit more solid. I really want him to see his mom being active and having fun! We don't own a tv or an ipad, and we won't be parking him in front of Netflix. I try to take him on a picnic and a hike once a week, we go sit outside and I read to him, and I take him on walks when my back allows it. I really want a strong base of activity, whole foods, and respect for the outdoors, and hopefully he takes to it as he grows older!

 As for my childhood, it sucked. I was raised by a single father who didn't know how to cook, so we ate out for every meal. Sodas were the norm, and I usually had 2  day. I wasn't encouraged to be fit, and he made fun of me when I wanted to wear shorts so I could go play (he said I was too pale and looked like a cancer patient). I wasn't allowed to go to my friend's very often, and I only got to go to the park if I was at my grandmother's. Basically, he did everything he could to ensure that I'd be fat and suffer from body image issues.

That takes care of a good chunk of their fitness but my wife and I also take them hiking at least once a week and we all play at least one hard game of soccer against each other each week. Pretty much everything we do is fun, even if it does wear us out.

"My son, now 13, was close to obese overweight, some 2 years back. He was born big frame but he was accumulating fat at alarming rate. We were aware that apart from diet changes cardio was the only way he could shed some weight. So we started him in badminton classes. He went there for about 6 months but there was no visible difference in his weight. Also he kept on complaining about pain in his knees. We realized his weight was a hindrance in doing cardio which involved legs. Unfortunately almost every cardio puts a lot of strain on legs and especially knees when you are overweight. There was only one great option which was easier on knees, swimming. So he started swimming. Slowly and gradually he found interest in the activity and increased his time. For last three months he is preparing with other state and national level swimmers and swims almost 3 hours daily (about 4-5 km) . This year he is planning to compete at district level. He is still overweight but he is loosing fat visibly, growing vertically and also developing a strong upper body. In last 3 months he lost about 6 kg weight. He is now conscious about his food intake and does not eat junk food. He has challenged his friends in school that when he would join school again after this summer vacations, he would be a transformed self. What are we doing? We plan his meals with balanced macros, keep eye on the timing of his diet, drop and pick him from pool everyday (about 3kms from home). We talk to him about his diet and macro intakes. Sometimes I take him for a long run (2-4 km) in the morning. He finds running more difficult than swimming.

"i lift with my gf 13 yo son, though he will be 14 in two weeks. for a long time we were trying to get him active and eating healthier, but its tough to say things with out giving him some kind of fat complex. but he was borderline obeese. we did our best to eat healthy with and around him, but we cant control what he eats at school and especially not what he eats at his dads. signed him up for karate and it helped a bit, but not nearly enough. unfortunately it ended up taking his dad saying something about his weight that really hurt him. since then he started lifting with me and has made great gains, well losses. he is starting to build a little muscle, but he doesnt eat enough. thats now our new worry and why we didnt want to go the dickhead route his dad went. edit: but this is a lot easier to talk about. because he does want bigger chest and arms, i can easily say man you gotta give your muscles the food they need to grow. lifting is the easy part. eating right and resting is where you get the results you want.

side comment. its strange how i grew up in the 80s and the stereotypical male physique to strive for was arnold, stallone, and the wrestlers. but now kids want to be tiny and lean. fit in skinny jeans with chicken legs. when we first started lifting i was telling him how important it was to do squats and deadlifts and do them right so you can have big legs and what not. not realizing it totally alienated them for him.",2015-05-29 19:14:26,kobenator,1

"So I started hitting the gym again for the first time in almost a year about a month ago now. I'm trying to cut right now because I've managed to put on a decent amount of extra fat weight (used to be incredibly skinny in my teens but now in my early 20's after filling out it's a lot easier for me to get a bit too bulky). So I read the wiki and FAQs and know that it is possible for beginners to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. 

So here is what is puzzling me: I've been eating a deficit pretty regularly, it's tricky starting out to change my eating habits completely, but it's getting easier. Also since I've started working out again I've felt myself get quite a bit stronger. I can definitely lift more weight in every single exercise that I do compared to what I was lifting a month ago. However, I was 183lbs starting out, and am still exactly 183lbs today. Do you guys think this is because I am gaining muscle mass while losing fat mass, therefore I should not worry about not losing any weight? Do you think I should try to create a larger calorie deficit? Or should I just keep going the path I am going and then once I've gotten all the ""noob muscle gains"" out of the way I will start to notice a decrease in weight?

It doesn't concern me too much, as my main goal working out is my own physical and mental health, however, it's a nice bonus to have a body you are more proud of and comfortable in. Just wondering what your advice is.",2015-05-29 15:58:48,CainRedfield,2

"Had the same problem bro, here's what helped:

Shower IMMEDIATELY after workout, like in the shower behind you at your gym right away.

Get and use a skin brush (one with a long handle so you can reach all of your back).

Try a body wash containing salicylic acid, or benzoyl peroxide (experiment, a month with each should give you a sense of their effectiveness). Use these with the brush.

After you dry off, use a moisturizer that contains lactic acid (AmLactin is a solid choice). If you can't reach your entire back buy a lotion applicator.

If you're not on gear then you're getting body acne because you're more frequently sweaty, and there's friction between your sweaty skin and your shirt while you're lifting (which grinds gunk into your pores and irritates existing infections).

"I think you're overthinking this. But if it really is bothering you, then you already know the answer. Buy furniture that *doesn't* cause you to need to hunch over, there's no *ideal* here because every body and it proportions are different, basing it on your hips doesn't help because maybe your arms are short, basing it on your elbows doesn't work because maybe your *upper* arm is shorter in relation to your forearm...etc. 

But also, recognize that some level of hunching over for general tasks isn't actually a problem. You're not damaging your back because you have to hunch over several times a day for short periods of time to perform certain tasks. (and really, unless you're putting *load* on these less-than-ideal positions over time, it's not going to 'ruin your posture', backs have a range of mobility for a reason)

On top of this. I mean, 6'2"" isn't *that* tall. It's basically just 'regular tall' and for the most part the world *is* designed to accommodate it. It's not until you get up and around 6'6"" (and more specifically, 6'6"" with disproportionately long limbs) that height starts to actually create a largely unavoidable complication with regards to interacting with daily life(read: ducking to enter nearly *every* room, *literally* unable to fit in some chairs/tables) and even then, plenty of people who are of that height and taller do perfectly fine with the counters, desks, chairs, tables...etc that everyone else uses.

This is generally higher than society would want, but is actually probably still lower than is ergonomically ideal. Point is, you can find your numbers by sitting at adjustable furniture and experimenting.

"I only read the first few dozen posts but did anyone answer?

There are two answers I know. 

First is that for heavy work (e.g. a work bench where you will be packing boxes for shipping, working on engines, fixing desktop computers, etc., the surface should be about level with your belt. For medium work (e.g. a kitchen counter), the surface should be about level with your elbow or below the rib cage. For precision work (soldering, building models, etc.) it should be taller but still allow you to rest your arms on it, so roughly the bottom of your sternum. The modifier is that if you are working on tall things the table should be lower (because you are working above the table), and sink counter should be higher (because you reach down through the counter into the sink) you might bring it up a bit. I'm 6' and have a work table for precision work that sits at 47"", which I find comfortable. 

Method 2 says the ""correct height"" is found by standing up straight, arms relaxed, and measuring from wrists to floor. Depending on arm length and whether your height is in your legs or torso that could be anywhere from 38"" to 44"". The correct height by this rule for a table for me is 40"". 

These are guidelines, not hard rules, but even at 6' I need just about every surface raised compared to what stores usually sell. When it comes to commercial stuff I only buy ""bar height"" furniture.",2015-05-30 16:11:11,nazaveg,1

I just find back exercises, especially deadlifts help counteract it. Any situation where you have to bend to pick things up, heavy or not I'll use a deadlift type movement.

A couple of days after starting at this gym, I started wearing my usual football shorts which went down to my knees, but then some rugby shorts on top of these, so that I had pockets. The rugby shorts are quite short, hence wearing the football shorts underneath. 

Anyways, yesterday I had another gym regular introduce his friend to me, and jokingly introduced me as the 'double short guy' and that also got a few chuckles out of the surrounding gym members aswell. 

I was mortified, I didn't know this was occurring. I'll probably make the effort to buy some shorts with pockets now.",2015-05-30 07:14:20,alienshoes,206
"A gym story about my dad...Sorry it's a long one. 

 Tldr; gym community is important :)

 Since the all of us kids moved out of the house my parents joined the gym at the local community college, they've been members for about 3 years.  They  participate in all of their events and fund raisers, and know all of the staff who work there, as well as the members quite well.

 Last july, while my dad was minding his own business in our front yard, he had an Aortic Aneurysm that ruptured,  his Aorta dissected more than half way down his abdomen leaking blood around his heart...he made it against all odds - he survived, then he started the long road to recovery. I flew half way across the world to be there with my family;  my brother and sister were there too. He was in ICU for 3 weeks and the cardiac wing for 3 more... Part of the only reason he made it was because he was in such good shape.

One day i went with my mom to the gym to pause their membership.  Everyone greeted my mom and asked her where she had been (they usually go 3+ times a week)  and greeted her with hugs. She told them the story and the girls cried and hugged my mom, they wanted to come to the hospital to visit my dad!  So the next day two of them arrived and brought flowers,  a gym hat, and t-shirt. For a second I saw my parents as people (not only as mom and dad) and I was so proud that they had made such an impression at their gym and how much the gym community means to them. And my dad is in his 50's , the doctors said part of the only reason he survived was because he was in such good shape!  So keep up your fitness :)

A year later and my dad is doing well,  back in the gym too",2015-05-30 04:46:41,giant5quid,573

There is this middle aged Asian guy, stark naked, with his one leg on the sink counter. He is kind of blow drying his ass and balls, but getting into it in a weird way--like he was a stripper or something. Suddenly, the meatheads seemed a lot more normal to me.",2015-05-30 07:15:29,dogbunny,218

"I have a new gym rule. I think it's a really good way to enjoy/get the most out of our precious gym time.

* If I see a anyone in the gym a few times over a few weeks, I now make a point of saying ""Hello' to them. Even if they 'look' mean/scary/'funny'/rude, etc. Everyone, pretty much, responds positively; some more enthusiastic than others. 

* I don't cramp anyone's style or steal gains, just a quick, short ""Hi/Hey/Hello/Wassup/Good stuff"" as appropriate. 

* And this is for everyone - buff dudes, grannies, trainers etc etc (Although I am more restrained/circumspect with hot chicks, so there's no hint of hitting on them, [I hope...]) 

* Some people will then initiate/engage in chat later on - which is great - but I try to keep it short and about training.

* Now, I am at a relative level of 'friendly' with pretty much everyone in my gym - and I even began introducing people who were once strangers to each other and they are now 'gym friends'. 

* It makes for a much more efficient training session- as all the gym politics that can be a pain with 'strangers' become a much easier/happier transaction - as far as working-in, sharing equip or even when navigating human traffic jams in tight/busy areas... 

* The upside is that you actually have much more freedom/workout efficiency in the gym.",2015-05-30 04:36:23,MarcusBondi,477

"So yesterday was deadlift day and at first I wasn't planning on maxing out but then my friends were there and started watching me deadlift and said I should try a new max. My previous max was 425 lbs  and I got up to 405 and that went up really easy. I decided to go to 435 lbs and I managed to get that, although it was pretty hard. But then I decided why not go to 455 lbs, I was in the zone and decided to at least try it. I started the pull and the weight moved ever so slowly. In my mind I didn't think I was going to get it at first but then I managed to grind out and get to the top. As soon as I go to the top I felt something drip on my chest and thought it was sweat.... Nope, my nose started gushing blood. I set the weight down and literally ran to the nearest paper towel dispenser to stop the bleeding. I looked like a mad man with blood on my chest and shirt. But hey, at least I got a new PR! I cleaned up the blood and let the front desk know and then finished my workout!

My gym closed down today...,2015-05-30 06:17:15,Mupt,60
"Inspired by the other dad story I thought I'd write one of my own which seemed relevant. When I was 12 my Dad took me to the gym for the first time ever as he wanted a workout and was looking after me while my Mum was at some kids party with my brother and sister. He worked overseas and commuted back and forth and liked to work out when he could, which was about once a week at best, always busy and working hard he was constantly time poor. I know he always regretted not being able to stick to a stricter routine despite the fact he was a serious athlete in high school/college (Rowing, athletics, cricket and football rep teams). 

This particular gym was a serious big boy powerlifter/bodybuilder gym, with needle dispensers and sharps bins in the changing rooms and toilets (in the early 90s), ""special protein drinks"" not on the menu list- that kind of thing. Anyway these monsters in the gym were huge especially to a 12yo kid. Seriously intimidating.

A lot of them seemed to know my Dad when he walked in and came over to shake his hand, chat etc. I got the impression he was kind of a big deal, despite being 6'2 and 245lbs (112kg) and in his 40s. He wasn't ripped, just a big strong guy. In retrospect he was probably just under 20% BF and compared to a lot of these guys that looked like marble statues the size of walls- he was below average in size at best. He introduced me and they all said hi and joked around a bit, seemed like a decent bunch of scary behemoths. 

So we get changed and we warm up then stretch a bit, he shows me some pieces of equipment and 'how they work, makes me do some body weight stuff like push ups, sit ups, squats and burpees while he does some machine and dumbbell work. 

After a while we head over to the bench press and all the guys come on over while he's warming up and start watching, not saying much just silent. I thought at the time, it seemed a bit weird but I wasn't sure if that was normal gym etiquette or not. 

So he does a couple of sets for warm ups, starting on 100kg, 80 plus the bar and then working his way up. I don't remember all the sets and reps except I know he started getting spotted at 180kg which is about 400lbs and he maxed out at 230kg which is over 500lbs and the bar was bending atrociously while everyone cheered him on. I knew absolutely nothing about weights at that point but it looked like a lot of weight and I couldn't ever remember seeing him struggle with anything physical before. I was pretty impressed and more than a little proud when the biggest guy in the gym, a real colossus said ""You're dad is REALLY strong, did you know that?"" You know how you always think your Dad is strong when you are a kid but sometimes you don't actually have a clue. 

I didn't appreciate how strong he really was until I'd been lifting for about 5 years and I still wasn't even close to his numbers. Not to mention he never worked out more than once a week and sometimes went a month or two without working out at all. Now after I've been lifting regularly for 20 years and I'm still not at that level, I'm in awe. I remember he used to have a set of really old solid steel train wheels at home when I was a kid that he would do bicep curls and shoulder press with, I have no idea how heavy they would have been. 

My Mum told me stories of how he put his fist through brick wall when he was younger and picked up a harley davidson and threw it at someone when drunk. He was the the old school traditional strong silent type, brought up on a farm he didn't talk much but when he did you listened, a bit of a cowboy he also enjoyed a drink. And he didn't start fights but from all reports, he always finished them and never lost. 


My Dad died in 2010 of cancer. The strongest man I've ever known, cancer destroyed him. In the end he was a shell of his former self, just a huge broad frame, massive hands, his previously handsome face looked skeletal and drawn and his hair was falling out, he'd suffered a stroke due to tumours in his brain so he couldn't talk or move half his face. It was horrific but he still had his sense of humour and even the day before he died his handshake was crushingly strong til the last. It was devastating to see someone so physically awesome and powerful in his prime brought so low. 

I spent a few days and nights by his bedside towards the end in hospital but I wasn't there when he passed which I regret. A few days later at his funeral, almost all of his closest friends, men in their 50s and 60s were breaking down and crying their eyes out. One of the men that spoke at the funeral finished his speech with, ""Saying farewell to a legend is the hardest thing I've ever done and I could never do him justice, rest in peace my friend"".

I still vividly remember how he was once the strongest man I've ever known. I appreciate him so much more now that he's gone and regret not spending more time with him. When I have kids I shall tell them his story. Vale Dad.",2015-05-30 08:29:48,Science_isthenewcool,275

I know that for sure cause me wife is from Dublin, and I've been there many times."" My dad laughs, agrees, and tells the man that he got the shirt as a gift. The high sparrow look-a-like forces a half smile, lays down on the bench next to us, and starts reading a newspaper he pulled out of his pants.

He would load up the bar, do one rep, sit for 5 mins, load up another time, do one rep... I didn't mind, I was doing upper, and he happened to be doing this in my line of vision. Anyway, leg guy decides to do squats. He puts about 70kg on the bar, which must me about how much he weighed. I'm resting between sets and watch to see his technique. He goes loooowww. Buttwinks at the bottom, but gets up fine. Goes for another rep. He wobbles, and suddenly his back gives way. He's hunched over double, with the bar on his neck. I gasp and start to scramble to help, but somehow, I think through sheer adrenaline, he manages to right himself and push through. He looks around to see if anyone saw, and I pretended to be busy with my weights. Then, I think he must've been quite freaked out and distracted, he decided to unload the whole one side of the bar, which of course sends it flying into the air.

This guy came over and asked if he could watch my movements because I was lifting a lot of weight and seemed to know what I was doing. He also asked for some advice afterwards. I've never been so proud of myself.,2015-05-30 06:34:32,unicornsexploding,60
"This was actually last week, but close enough.

I'm about 8 weeks in on ICF 5x5, and most of it has been done on a cut so I'm starting to plateau (at what I consider somewhat low numbers, but then I remind myself it's a cut). I'm sitting on the bench getting ready to do a set with 170lb which I'm only about 70% confident I can get 5 reps of, so I start looking around for someone to spot me. Well, there was a guy on the decline situp bench thing in front of me, so I figure I'll just wait for him to finish his set and grab him. That turned out to be a mistake.

He finishes his set, and as he's getting up I ask him if he'd mind giving me a quick spot. He looked at me for a second, then comes back with the most confusing response I could imagine: ""You're not doing enough weight.""

I sit there for a second, trying to figure out if this is a joke or not. I really expect him to start laughing, then I'd start laughing, I'd get my spot, an we'd all move on. But, no. This guy is serious. He continues on, ""If you need a spot with that much weight, then you should lower it.""

I was dumbfounded. The only response I could process and get out of my mouth at that time was ""what?""

He stared at me for a second, then proceeded to walk off muttering something about how he had broken his back or something, which didn't seem like he was using as an excuse to not spot me, but more a reason why I should lower the weight. I really don't know.

So instead I grabbed the next guy that walked by, asked him to give me a spot (which he gladly did) and then I moved on. I was, however, so thrown off by the whole experience that I forgot to re-rack that bench, where I usually always make a point to re-rack when I'm done.

tl;dr: I'm too weak for a spot.",2015-05-30 09:04:22,AdorableZeppelin,22
"Earlier this week, I was doing OHP at the squat rack, and on my last set I look down and next to my water bottle is a GIANT spider, about the size of my hand. I grabbed some random dudes that were in between their sets to show them. I made a joke (although serious) about how I was going to wait till later when the spider disappeared to grab my water bottle, and one of the guys mustered up the courage to grab it for me really quick. However, none of us had the courage to step on it. I was too scared i'd miss, crawl up my leg, bite me, and kill me. To this day, the beast has not been seen again and still lurks in the gym, underneath the deadlift pad (I believe thats where its living).",2015-05-30 07:09:02,pyouells,56

I'm 18 so I was like wtf, I turn around and it's one of the most buff guys at my gym, he said go wash your hands. I open my mouth to tell him I was about to and I do wash my hands everytime it's just someone's calling me. Just as im about to tell him he says I don't care just go wash while giving me the son I'm dissapointed look. So I just gave up, missed my call, and washed my hands.

"Got someone kicked out of my gym. 

I had worked our for about an hour and a half and I was ready to go home. So I decided I'd go stretch my calves on the calf block. 

In walks my friend who I haven't seen in about a month. He just got here so I decided I'd chat with him for a minute. We talked for at most 45 seconds before a guy in his 30's - 40's comes storming up to us and kicks the calf block out from under my feet and starts using it himself. 

I figured it was best to not confront him about it. Seemed like a weird dude. The guy left for a minute and then came back and mumbled something at us. I said ""what?"" then he gets in my face and goes ""WHAT?!"" 

He starts yelling ""ARE YOU GOING TO DO SOMETHING OR JUST HOLD THAT FUCKING POLE UP?"" I didn't even try explaining that I was stretching before I went home. 

He then starts yelling ""I'm tired of you fucking douche bag kids that stand around and fucking text each other all day. Fucking douchebags"" (I'm 21 btw) 

Definitely embarrassing, because everyone in the gym was looking at us. I'm sure they all thought we were just fucking around considering they didn't know the context of this dude being nuts. 

Anyways management escorted him out. Not sure if he's banned or not. Definitely put me off from the gym for about a week. I know everyone that lifts isn't like that, but it was kind of upsetting.",2015-05-30 10:00:02,Sublimebro,16

"Warming up to pull 535, everything is feeling super light. Finally the moment of truth: I feel a little bloated as I close the lever on my belt, strange. A large behemoth of a man, simply known as Kong, gives me an approving nod.  I approach the bar, get into position, sink my hips, begin the pull. About half way up the thing we all fear most happens: I let one rip. The tiniest of farts slipped out.  I panicked for a split second. Decide to keep pulling. About 3/4 of the way up it happens again. This giant is watching me and I can see the sides of his lips start to curl. I wanted to keep pulling but the time for glory had passed.  We both busted out laughing and I ended up dropping the weight. I know I could have pulled it, sometimes shit happens...

This fucking dude comes up to me and says that I don't have a plan for my training?! I mean all my major lifts are easily at least 40 percent higher than his. What makes you say stupid shit like that? 

Yes I do have plan, yes I do follow it, not to the letter, but I follow it.

It made me feel so uncomfortable that I took out my earphones and tried really hard not to make any grunts, groans, loud sighs. He left and I felt utterly defeated, I can't believe he'd made me feel like that in my safe haven. Anyway, he came back (must have been in the loo) and I decided that I was going to take stand! I went over to the core/cool down area...RIGHT next to him (we're talking a foot away at most)and started stretching/lunging/crunching and making every noise and face I could think of.

This guy was pretty big, and was deadlifting 3 plates when I arrived. I set up for squats in the rack next to him, as we only have the two in my gym. Between sets I'm half watching him. He's clearly warming up, as he does a set and then adds a fourth plate to either side. And then a fifth. And a sixth. And a seventh. And finally, he adds an eighth plate to either side of the bar. At this point, I'm not even lifting anymore, I'm just watching him and wondering if he can even fit any more plates on there of if he's going to need to start getting creative to go any higher. 

He proceeds to bang out 8 plates for 5 reps. It was beautiful to watch. However, that isn't why this is noteworthy.

This guy was either snorting chalk, or was dusting his hands with cocaine. 

Every couple sets, I watched him reach into this bag of white powder and put in on his hands, which I assumed was chalk. But, before his big set, he very clearly put a line of this ""chalk"" on his fist and snorted it. I'm not sure which would be stranger.",2015-05-30 09:37:44,TheBigDsOpinion,28

If you're burning 300-400 calories in a cardio session but gulping down 200 calories in electrolyte drinks, you're doing yourself a disservice.

Even in this scenario, your body can replace those electrolytes through an otherwise normal diet with superior macros. The drinks are more of a quick convenience.

"It would be really hard to do for a regular lifter. Even so, Lyle McDonald recommends doing at least 2 weeks of eating at maintenance levels to normalize your hormone levels before bulking again.

However, there are a few who think that bodybuilders dieting down to extreme bodyfat levels over extended periods of time can do damage to their metobolism. Not really a lot of hard evidence though.

Here's Layne Norton, PhD in nutritional sciences, talking about metobolic damage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHHzie6XRGk

EDIT: To clarify for the downvoters, this is talking about eating 800-1000 calories and 2 hours of cardio and lifting in addition to that. That's a bit more extreme territory than /r/fitness is used to. But Layne only has anecdotes, so it's all speculation until there are some studies on it

Meaning if you don't do any activity you'll burn roughly 1600k, but since you'll lift and cardio you can afford to eat a bit more. Always start at a higher calories, track you weight than start cutting the calories. Cut carbs. I'd do 25 carbs every three days. Measure the weight, aslong as its going down every three days. Keep the macros the same or calories. Whenn it stalls, cut another 25 grams of carbs, or add 100 calories of cardio. Sometimes easier to add cardio then cutting calories.

"Taking this a little below the surface beyond just metabolism, but more specifically: leptin.

I follow a protocol based on advice from Martin Berkhan that includes calorie cycling (deficit cycling) to help leptin sensitivity.  I eat at maintenance on lifting days but at a caloric deficit on non-lifting days -- yet my weekly numbers have me at a caloric deficit for cutting.  

You can read the full article here: [Intermittent Fasting, Set-Point and Leptin](http://www.leangains.com/2010/03/intermittent-fasting-set-point-and.html)

Some of the main points:

* &gt; Leptin is a master-hormone with downstream effects on other hormones related to metabolism (T3/T4, neuropeptide-Y, epinephrine, among many others).


* &gt; In the long-term, leptin is regulated by total amount of fat mass. A drop in leptin affects the other hormones negatively and vice versa. Low leptin leads to an increase in hunger and a decrease in metabolic rate, much like high leptin leads to a decrease in hunger and an increase in metabolic rate.



* &gt; I think most people diet too hard, which has a profoundly negative effect on leptin - and this is part of the reason why the weight gain rebound is so common in folks who finally manage to reach their goal (and then screw up everything by binging).



* &gt; Planned and regular refeeds should be in place. This affects leptin positively and allows for maintenance of muscle and strength. Even if your goal ultimately is fat loss, entering an anabolic phase with post-workout overfeeding will serve you well.",2015-05-30 13:14:37,1P221,1

I would suggest you figure out your tdee (or the tdee of your goal weight) and start reverse dieting now.  2 and 1/2 months is a long ass time to be eating at such a deficit.  You're likely to suffer nutrient deficiencies and could possibly develop an eating disorder.  (It happens physiologically.)  The standard advice is to not drop below 1000 calories.

You can maintain any weight (or cut/bulk) the healthy way by figuring out how many calories your body uses in a day (tdee) and adding or subtracting from that.

Strategy question: I assume you don't want to kill yourself on the squat portion of the meet so you have some energy for the deadlift / bench. Do you have a plan / strategy for this? Did you miss a lift squatting or just decide to stop? How does that all work?",2015-05-31 05:57:38,amfoejaoiem,10

"First of all congrats on the result!
Secondly, I have a question about squat stance. I noticed you're a fellow narrow stance squatter whereas most powerlifters adopt a much wider stance. Any particular reason you're squatting this way? I have tried a wider stance myself but I have a lot of trouble hitting depth so i stuck to narrow since I have a much stronger bounce from the hole.",2015-05-31 07:26:50,leopold666,3

Bench press straight bar like that in my (admittedly limited) experience is 45lbs.  So that's 353lbs.  Where did the final 22lbs come from?

"At the beginning of this year my very fit friend (a kung fu instructor and fitness nut) invited me to the gym and I, a fat out of shape guy, agreed. We'd go to the gym Saturdays and Sundays together and he'd kill me with his tabata shit and jumping around and lifting all these heavy things, but eventually I stopped getting sore and started going to the gym on my own during weekdays and meeting up with him on weekends. 

Yesterday we're doing pushups with 50 lbs on our backs until burnout, then lowering the weights. I did quite well, almost as well as he did. He commented on the size of my chest and then said, ""I'm going to be so pissed if you get in better shape than me.""

That was the best compliment of the year so far, to hear I am on my way to reaching that caliber of fitness. And it's true; I've gone from wheezing up a flight of stairs to getting to the gym six days a week.

At the very end when we were both exhausted he started walking to the change room and I told him I wanted to hit the bench before we go. I think that took him by surprise. I can't wait to hit the one year mark and see where I'll be. He can still crush me on the bench press, but one day...",2015-05-31 08:29:36,Godfodder,34

I'm working out 5-6 days per week here, and haven't taken a lazy off day since I've been here (3 weeks so far). I'm definitely still losing weight (no creatine or protein supplementation, not as much time to work out per day), but I'm not losing as much muscle as I did last year.

I went  again Saturday night and did my pull routine and was  completely worn out by the end of the workout. The  atmosphere of the gym is great. It's only 10 bucks a month  and its 24 hours.. how freaking amazing is that with no  contract. My favorite part was when I was talking with the  guy who signed me up he was going over a few of the rules  that if they weren't followed they could cancel your  membership. 1.

Squat is still stuck at 120Kg 1RM, but managed 1x5 225.75Kg leg press @ 70.4Kg BW.

Managed to do hanging knee twists, always saw folk doing them thinking that must be very difficult.  I see people using momentum to do them but doing them slowly and controlled is where the burn is at.

Also managed 70 flights of my 100 flight stepper ma jiggy today without holding onto the bars/railings.  Note to self I must learn the correct name for that machine.",2015-05-31 07:06:45,WT-RikerSpaceHipster,2

Anyway, after about a week of form practice with just a bar, a bunch of swim buddies and I decided to test out our strength. I was happy and surprised to say that I got a 315 deadlift, 185 bench, and a 255 squat as 1rm. For 3rm, I got 285 dead, 225 squat, and 155 bench.

150x5

175x5

205x3

245x5

280x5

320x5

4x7 @ 255

I plowed through those 28 reps, the last set was just as fast as the first.  Really proud of that.  I know I've got a long way to go, but it was a huge confidence boost.",2015-05-31 09:10:41,Orsson,2

OHP felt pretty good and I did an extra set on top of my 5x5 with 110lbs on the bar. Then I moved onto squats which felt tough as I warmed up, my legs felt tight and even 165 felt heavier than usual.

Anyway I manged to do my 5 sets with 210lbs which I honestly didn't think I was going to be able to finish.

Going to be doing Stronglifts twice a week (I run a lot).

Yesterday I did too many of the excercises because of getting overexcited, but my starting numbers are:

Deadlift: 5x5 110lbs (I know, should be 1x5)

Bench: 5x5 105lbs

Squat 3x5 100lbs (did it right after deadlifts and was wiped out.)

Row: 5x5 80lbs? I did 5x2x5 45lb single arm dumbell which was pretty easy. Not sure how this will translate to barbell.

OHP: No idea. I'll start at the bar, and add 10lbs if that seems easy on day 2.

Chinups: 3 x 8.

"I started as a real, hardcore skinny fat. Much worse than these guys posting pics here. I bulked first, and that was my biggest mistake. I got fat and my progress was slow, i now wish i had cut first. You can make strenght gains on a cut as a beginner, and it won't take you long to drop to 11,12% BF and start a slow bulk. Also it's been proven that musce-fat gain ratio is much worse after 15%. You will probably end around 20% at least and you'll have to cut hard then.",2015-05-31 17:26:32,shimeshugar,6
"It seems going from skinny fat to strong fat is easiest. Since you are already use to the belly it won't bother you as the rest of the body gets noticeably better. Eventually though, the fat gain catches up to you and makes muscle gaining progressively harder. That's when it's time to lose the extra weight, but at this point you are far stronger, faster, train smarter &amp; have more endurance to lose the weight with.

The problem I see with skinny fats who cut first is that it's never enough. The keep trying to lose weight but there is nothing there to see. So they keep cutting trying to see abs. But with no muscle or strength they get stuck going no where. They end up skinny weak and don't see results from training.",2015-05-31 15:28:12,broscientologist,9

"The reason a person looks ""skinny fat"" in the first place is due to the lack of muscle definition. So yes, if you bulk and put on some muscle, you will look better because you will have more muscle mass. It doesn't mean you will look like your ideal image, but the fact is you made obvious progress in a positive direction toward your future fitness and health goals. Adding lean mass can only help you in the future no matter what your goals are, and you have to start somewhere. The only other alternatives are cutting, in which case you will just end up looking ""skinny"" with neither fat nor muscle (And people will probably think you have an eating disorder), or getting fat without putting on muscle, which is obviously the worst possible thing.

Guess what your next step is after bulking for 3 years? You cut. Cutting fucking sucks.

The whole reason why skinny fat people look the way they deal is because they don't have any damn muscle.  I promise you you'd be better off being muscular and having 22% body fat than being 18% body fat and having little musculature.

i'd probably bite the bullet and do an initial cut down to around 10 or 12% bf first, before slow bulking back up to 16%.  

get rid of the fat first and then worry about building muscle, but to each their own.  you'll put a little bit of muscle on in the beginning anyway.",2015-05-31 15:47:58,sck_2008,-1
