"Serious question: What do people think Creationists believe about dating through observable and measurable science?  A Creationist believes that the world was created in a day, but on that first day, in the very first moment, you would have been surrounded by things that appeared to have been there for a very long time.  An objective view of the earth that first afternoon would have been that things had been there for a measurable period.  And not just seconds.  Perhaps thousands, millions or billions of years.  Trees would have rings.  Rocks would be in layers.  Adam and Eve are never implied to be mere seconds old.  Creationists believe in a ""Young Earth"", but it's a ""Youth Earth"" that was created with an Age.  There is no other option.  All of the scientific methods used to judge dates and sequence of events would point to there being something ""before"".  It's just that Creationists believe that the ""before"" didn't really exist.

If someone's argument is that any scientific evidence that shows the world to be older than 6,000 years old proves Creationists wrong, then they are not even giving a moments thought to what a Creationist actually believes before they try to prove them wrong.  Because what could that one day old world even look like?  How could you possibly have a world that observable evidence would show to be one day old?  There is no way to have something that in itself indicates that it spontaneously existed.

"If someone was so hateful toward a group of people which comprise the majority of the country thy live in, wouldn't they move to a place where that element doesn't exist? The answer is no. Because despite what you may understand about enforcing ""diversity"" or minority activism, it is mostly not about actually achieving those things. It is really only about one thing, the feelings of power and an outlet for emotional anguish.

This girl, Bahar Mustafa, most likely came from a middle class home with all modern amenities, was given a proper education, and attends a good University in London. Essentially she belongs to the ""privileged"" strata of society, and no matter how much hair dye she uses or how many facial piercings she has will change that.

She, like other radical leftists, have internal feelings of defeatism, low self-esteem and angst. This causes the gravitation towards groups who view themselves as disenfranchised. (Minority groups, gender activist groups, LGBT groups etc..) This causes the craving to empower herself over her environment, the best way to accomplish this is through intimidation and shaming. Making other people submit to demands and to apologize, in which being a ""diversity officer"" is a dream job.

She hates western society and the idea of males and masculinity because they represent images of strength and success. They represent obstacles in her drive for power. That is why these movements are well organized with groups, collectivism is key an the radical leftist agenda, and they can't have any pesky white male types listening in on that agenda in meetings (Hence the no white people signs). The collectivism is also important because it contributes to the power struggle, whether that be activist in nature or ""support"" groups like sexual assault PTSD, these groups provide roles that satiate the desire for empowerment.

While at one point most of the true feelings were concealed and the real motives were disguised as empathetic attempts at betterment and equality, the true motivations are now being expressed, as these types become more confident in expressing their hatred unchecked.

So if you are white, remember, this is the future your children will be left to, these are the people who will be grooming the future leaders. The literal other side of the spectrum of stormfront is becoming increasingly influential in the university system worldwide. We all notice it, and it is important to understand the real motivations behind these types of people.

"&gt; Media carries with it a credibility that is totally undeserved. You have all experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I call it by this name because I once discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect, than it would otherwise have.)

  &gt; Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward-reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them.

   &gt;In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story-and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

   &gt;That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I’d point out it does not operate in other arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one part, untruthful in all.

   &gt;But when it comes to the media, we believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly isn’t. The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia.

&gt; Bohannon had done similar work before — in 2013 he submitted a fake research paper to more than 300 open-access journals as part of a sting operation for the journal Science. But the idea for this operation came from Peter Onneken and Diana Lobl, two German reporters working on a documentary about “junk science” in the diet industry. They had recruited a doctor, Gunter Frank, to run a clinical trial, and 15 people to participate in the study.

According to him, in order to get research grants these days it's actually more profitable to make an extreme claim that is only tentatively backed up by the facts of your study than to actually do good science. 

Using the subject of the article, a study that confirms for the 100th time that yes, chocolate makes you fat, is probably good science, but doesn't grab attention. But if you tell people that your *breakthrough* science found that chocolate *does* help you lose weight, even if that amount of data you're basing that on falls just barely outside standard variable metrics, then you publish that to make yourself more appealing to future grant givers.

Now, not all scientists do this, and I'd wager *most* of them don't, but they are humans too and whenever humans are involved, shortcuts will be taken eventually. The only way I see this problem getting better is creating some kind of joint science-journalism panel to sift through the shit and find the stuff actually worth reporting on, but the odds of that happening are probably close to 0.",2015-05-29 00:57:35,Codoro,2

"Oh gawd how bad things have gotten.

I was in this exact situation fifteen years ago (throwaway for obvious reasons) I was sitting on my porch this time with a knife when the police came up and asked me what i was doing. I told them i was going to kill myself. They asked me to put down the knife but i didn't. Instead of shooting me they just asked me to sit cross legged (i guess they wanted me to slow me down in case i went crazy and wanted to attack them). Then you know what they did? The office got a lawn chair (from my neighbors house) and fucking TALKED to me for two hours. 

He threw me a coke a couple times during those hours and and three other squad cars showed up. You know what they did? They asked if i wanted a burger (i didn't). Meanwhile the first cop kept talking to me and asking what;s wrong. I cried like a fucking baby as i explained to him why i wanted to kill myself. Finally I got up and threw them the knife like they asked and they took me to the hospital. Didn't even cuff me after i gave them the knife. Just asked me to get in the back of the squad car. 

Where the fuck did those cops go? These cops that shoot people aren't the cops i remember. Whatever happened to the good cops?

There is a huge problem with this. Talk to people working in the mental health field, when someone is suicidal or having a bad episode one of the last things you want to do is use force or restrain them. It will **only** escalate the situation.

"My cousin and I were just talking about this on Sunday. We were walking along the beach and saw a group of police cars on the beach's bike path ahead of us and he and I both agreed to turn around and go in the other direction. We were already talking about politics and life and I mentioned to him, ""Isn't it odd that we feel this sort of fear when we see the police? We don't feel safe or protected, we feel frightened. When we're driving and a cop drives behind us, we don't feel safe or protected, we feel harassed even if we're abiding by every law we know. This isn't how society should be."" He and I are both black but I don't feel like this is a black issue but an issue many people feel when seeing cops out and about. In the back of our heads, we know that many of these officers are probably good people, but just knowing that there are a select few that do harass and take that authority to a whole other level is really scary especially when they can do a lot of different things like arrest you and ruin your name for years not to mention legally kill you and walk away from it as long as they make it look justified.

I remember growing up and watching shows like The Andy Griffith Show and thinking how nice it would be to have police like Andy and Barney who seem so friendly and approachable. Today it just feels like you can't really do much of anything when an officer is in uniform. They don't seem human, they're something else like our masters we must listen and obey. Stories like this one just add to that fear knowing that some of these guys are out there and have this sort of mentality. In addition to the select few, it's difficult to not lump all of the cops together when you have good cops covering the bad ones because of this ""brotherhood"" they all feel.

Anyways, Amazon came through and I had my new helmet a few hours later. It only cost me $5.99 or something.

I eventually realized it's often a couple weeks before I get around to it. So now instead I'll take a minute and  hop on Amazon and get it two days later. For me at least, Amazon is much faster than going the brick-and-mortar route.",2015-05-29 00:21:41,joeomar,2

"“We take a long-term view on all these programs” 

No shit. Amazon is an amazing company in that they're such a dominant market force with huge investor support and yet they hardly ever turn a profit",2015-05-28 10:26:31,flounder19,3

There have been many times that I have decided to go out to a store to get something instead of getting it on Amazon for the sole reason that I would have to wait two days for it to arrive.,2015-05-28 13:04:13,DarthJones1,1

"I used to work as a laparoscopic technician during these cases. It was essentially a meat grinder that would throw tissue all over the abdomen. Many more companies other than J&amp;J had them. 

The two hospitals i worked for stopped using them and stopped doing supracervical hysterectomys. Now they do Vaginal Hysterectomys laparoscopically assisted. They have other ways of doing myomectomys too.",2015-05-28 18:38:20,Kraymes,40
"When they're referring to cancer spreading, they're talking about spreading it to other places in the same patients body right?  I remember some other article talking about a colonoscopy scope i think that was spreading bacteria bewteen people but i dont think this is the same situation? 

Cancer cant spread between people cause the second persons immune system would recognize it as foreign and attack it as i understand it.  It leads me to another question though... 

If someone ate a chuck of someone elses cancer of whatever type...  what would happen?  They get sick?  Cancer takes root some how?  nastiest BM ever?

These are the hard hitting questions we need answers to damnit.",2015-05-28 19:40:54,miserable_asshole,17
"I love that at the end of the article United Healthcare has decided to make hysterectomies more difficult to get. Because that just solves the problem. Never gets old, telling women what to do with their bodies, does it?",2015-05-28 20:25:58,Spikekuji,-2
So is this specifically a concern in fibroid removal alone? My mother had a laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy in early fall of last year with what I thought was a similar method - I believe there was division of the pieces and then vaginal removal. Would that require the same tool or are those types of procedures different?,2015-05-28 20:40:29,vivellimac,1
